<HEAD>Soviet-Bloc Nations May Buy Boeing, McDonnell Passenger Planes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Eastern European countries have begun
talks with the <organization>Boeing</organization> and <organization>McDonnell Douglas</organization> aircraft companies to
supply long-range passenger planes to replace aging Soviet
equipment in their national airlines, Deputy Secretary of <organization>State</organization>
<person>John C. Whitehead</person> said <date>Friday</date>.
   <person>Whitehead</person>, just back from a two-week trip to four Soviet-bloc
countries, told reporters ``my impression is they are very much
interested in buying <location>U.S.</location> planes. It's a significant thing,
psychologically, I believe _ Eastern European countries flying <location>U.S.</location>
planes.''
   He declined to identify the countries that expressed interest,
but another official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
were <location>Poland</location>, <location>Hungary</location> and <location>Romania</location>.
   If deals are arranged it would be the first <location>U.S.</location> aircraft sales
to <location>Hungary</location> and <location>Poland</location>.
   In the early <date>1970s</date>, <location>Romania</location> purchased several <organization>Boeing</organization> 707
passenger jets under a contract arranged at a time when the <location>United
States</location> was wooing <location>Romania</location> in hopes of increasing that country's
independence from <location>Moscow</location>.
   <person>Whitehead</person> said that from the <organization>State Department</organization>'s viewpoint, ``it
would be feasible and desirable'' for the sales, but he noted two
major stumbling blocks.
   Buying <location>U.S.</location> aircraft would require large expenditures by the
governments and credits from the <organization>U.S. Export-Import Bank</organization> for the
purchases would not be available, <person>Whitehead</person> said.
   The aircraft companies, moreover, would be prohibited from
selling equipment on a list of military-applicable goods banned for
export to communist countries. This could limit the type of
airplanes the countries could buy.
   ``There is some navigational equipment that could not be on the
planes,'' <person>Whitehead</person> said. ``They would have to buy stuff that would
not be on the (embargo) list.''
   <person>Whitehead</person>, the No. 2 official in the <organization>State Department</organization>, has
assumed special responsibility for a <location>U.S.</location> effort to gain influence
in countries that have been dominated by the <location>Soviet Union</location> since
World War II.
   Under the policy, the <location>United States</location> has offered the nations
increased trade and better relations in general, in return for
improved human rights performance and the institution of free
economic policies. On his latest trip, <person>Whitehead</person> visited <location>Poland</location>,
<location>Romania</location>, <location>Bulgaria</location> and <location>Czechoslovakia</location>.
   <person>Whitehead</person> said he told <organization>Romanian</organization> leader <person>Nicolae Ceausescu</person> that
his country is in danger of losing special trading rights granted
by <organization>Congress</organization> each year to reward <location>Romania</location> for its relatively free
emigration policies.
   The trading rights _ most-favored-nation status _ have been
worth <money>hundreds of millions of dollars</money> to <location>Romania</location> in previous years,
but renewal for <date>1988</date> has been suspended by <organization>Congress</organization> because the
<person>Ceausescu</person> government's human rights policies are considered
repressive, especially toward religious minorities.
   <person>Whitehead</person> said he told the Romanian leader there was only a
``50-50 chance it would be renewed, but there was still time.''
   <person>Ceausescu</person>, in keeping with previous discussions with <location>U.S.</location>
officials, refused to discuss the human rights issues on grounds
they were strictly an internal matter, <person>Whitehead</person> said.
   ``I came home with not much reason to hope there will be
improvement,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister <person>Yitzhak Shamir</person> said <date>Friday</date> his
coalition partner and rival, Foreign Minister <person>Shimon Peres</person>, was
going behind his back in an effort to sabotage <person>Shamir</person>'s strategy
for <location>Middle East</location> peace.
   His accusation came the day after <person>Peres</person> suggested that
intransigence by <person>Shamir</person> thwarted talks with King <person>Hussein</person> of <location>Jordan</location>,
which the foreign minister said could have averted Palestinian
riots in the occupied <location>West Bank</location> and <location>Gaza Strip</location>.
   At the center of the argument over peace is an initiative by the
<location>United States</location>.
   Israeli officials said Secretary of <organization>State</organization> <person>George P. Shultz</person>
telephoned <person>Peres</person> and <person>Shamir</person> on <date>Thursday</date> to say he will visit the
<location>Middle East</location> after his scheduled <date>Feb. 21-23</date> trip to <location>Moscow</location>.
   <location>U.S.</location> envoy <person>Richard Murphy</person> outlined the new American ideas to
<location>Israel</location>'s coalition government this week.
   According to Israeli officials, the plan calls for an
international conference, possibly in <location>Geneva</location>, as a means of
beginning Arab-Israeli talks by <date>April</date>.
   Negotiations would focus first on a temporary autonomy plan for
the 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied territories. Talks on
the final status of the <location>West Bank</location> and <location>Gaza Strip</location> would begin by
<date>December</date> even if self-government had not begun.
   <person>Peres</person> immediately endorsed the proposals, but <person>Shamir</person> said
clarifications were needed, and expressed reservations about the
rapid timetable and international role. <person>Shamir</person> leads the right-wing
<organization>Likud</organization> bloc and <person>Peres</person> head the center-left <organization>Labor Party</organization>.
   On <location>Israel</location> radio <date>Thursday</date>, the prime minister expressed
frustration over what called leaks intended to undercut his
negotiating position.
   ``Every expression of cooperation on my part is thrown in my
face immediately,'' he said. ``I show Mr. <person>Peres</person> a letter and after
a few hours it is in the hands of all the reporters.
   ``Everything he does is in the middle of the night. What I do he
wants to know about so that he can sabotage it.''
   <person>Shamir</person> accused <person>Peres</person> of surrendering to Arab demands for the
return of land captured in the <date>1967</date> <location>Middle East</location> war.
   ``How can you conduct negotiations together when your partner
runs every day and every minute to the other side and says, `Don't
listen to what <person>Shamir</person> says, I'll sell it to you cheaper?''' <person>Shamir</person>
declared.
   <person>Moshe Shahal</person> of the <organization>Labor Party</organization> rejected <person>Shamir</person>'s claim that
<person>Peres</person> was ``overeager'' to accept the <location>U.S.</location> proposals.
   ``We are not being overeager. The prime minister is trying to
give an excuse for a period of no movement,'' he said.
   In a speech to party members <date>Thursday</date> night, <person>Peres</person> indirectly
accused <person>Shamir</person> of blocking an international conference agreed to by
<person>Jordan</person>.
   ``If the negotiations with an international opening had begun in
<date>April</date>, when they could have been started, would or would it not
have spared us the events in the territories?'' <person>Peres</person> said.
   Riots began <date>Dec. 8</date> and more than 50 Arabs have been killed,
nearly all of them by Israelis, accurding to <organization>U.N.</organization> figures.
   In an interview with <organization>Hearst Newspapers</organization> correspondent <person>John P.
Wallach</person>, <person>Shamir</person> said: ``It's not a question of intransigence, of a
refusal to talk about it, but I don't want to make the American
government fail.
   ``If we come today with King <person>Hussein</person> and the other Arabs, and
try to negotiate about the final status, the negotiations will
explode immediately. <location>Israel</location> will say, `We want Israeli
sovereignty.' The other side will say, `We want Arab sovereignty'
and it is finished. ... It will be over before it starts.''
   <person>Shamir</person> said a five-year period was needed between Palestinian
autonomy and talks about a final settlement so confidence and trust
could be built. He said that was the concept in the <date>1978</date> <location>Camp David</location>
accords, which led to the peace treaty with <location>Egypt</location> in <date>March 1979</date>.
   <location>Israel</location> television said <person>Shamir</person> sent a letter to <person>Shultz</person> on
<date>Wednesday</date> requesting changes in the <location>U.S.</location> proposal, but <person>Shultz</person>
refused.
   It said <person>Shamir</person> asked the Americans to drop the international
conference, extend the autonomy timetable and not to set a date for
talks about the final status of the occupied territories.
   The prime minister also asked the <location>United States</location> to enlist the
support of other countries for building urban neighborhoods to
house the <location>Gaza Strip</location>'s Palestinian refugees, <person>repoort</person> said.

<HEAD>Additions To Endangered Species List Hit Near Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <organization>Fish and Wildlife Service</organization> added 59 species
to the list of endangered and threatened species last year, the
second highest total ever, the service said <date>Thursday</date>.
   In the previous most active year, <date>1979</date>, 68 species were added.
   The list now stands at 993 animals and plants, of which 513 are
found only in foreign countries, the service said in a year-end
report.
   One species was removed from the list after confirmation of its
long-suspected extinction _ the Amistad gambusia, a small fish
found in some springs in <location>Texas</location>.
   Another species died out during the year, but the paperwork to
remove it from the list has not been completed, spokesman <person>David
Klinger</person> said. This was the dusky seaside sparrow, whose last
survivor, an elderly male in captivity, died in <location>Florida</location>.
   Among other reasons to call it a good year, the service noted
its reestablishment of the red wolf in the wild in <location>North Carolina</location>,
the growth of the <organization>Chesapeake Bay</organization> bald eagle population from 136
pairs to 161, successful captive breeding of the black-footed
ferret and establishment of a second population of <location>California</location> sea
otters off the coast near <location>Los Angeles</location>.
   Too late to make the report was the successful mating of condors
in captivity in <location>California</location>. The service removed the last condor
from the wild last year on <date>Easter Sunday</date>, and hopes to rebuild the
population through breeding in captivity.
   Environmentalists have complained that under the <person>Reagan</person>
administration, the service has been moving far too slowly in
making decisions, and that it will take 16 years or so to work
through the backlog of about 1,000 candidate species.
   They have said that in the last 20 years, 300 species became
extinct while waiting for a decision.
   Listing of a species as threatened or endangered under the <date>1973</date>
Endangered Species Act means federal agencies must consult the
service about any of their activities which could harm it. Also,
the service must draft and try to carry out a recovery plan, of
which 222 are in effect.

   A research satellite launched last week to
test elements of the proposed ``Star Wars'' anti-missile shield
failed in a secondary tracking excercise when an optical sensor
gave false data to two on-board computers, an <organization>Air Force</organization> official
said <date>Friday</date>.
   <organization>Air Force</organization> Col. <person>John Otten</person>, assistant director of the <organization>Strategic
Defense Initiative</organization>'s kinetic energy office, said an optical sensor
on <organization>Delta</organization> 181, a satellite used to test ``Star Wars'' sensors and
trackers, gave flawed data when it tried to track target objects
that were beyond its range.
   <person>Otten</person> said the sensor data went into the computers, causing them
to respond inappropriately. He said the flaw was detected within an
hour and the computers were told to ignore the data. This corrected
the problem.
   Some of the test data on the system was lost because of the
problem, but <person>Otten</person> said the loss was minor because the tracking
exercise was a secondary objective. ``In the fundamental mission we
suceeded,'' he said.
   <organization>Delta</organization> 181 was launched <date>Feb. 8</date> from the <location>Kennedy Space Center</location> and
spent 12 hours conducting a series of tests to gather data needed
to refine the SDI, or ``Star Wars,'' anti-missile system.
   Program manager <person>Andy Green</person> last week called the flight ``a very
successful mission.''
   However, <organization>Aviation Week and Space Technology</organization>, in a story prepared
for <date>Monday</date> publication, said the satellite was unable to complete
``battle management fire control computations.''
   The magazine blamed the problem on the computers, but <person>Otten</person> said
the flaw actually was caused by the optical sensor attempting to
lock onto an object beyond its range.
   Sensors on the satellite were used to track 14 sub-satellite
targets released in two groups from the <organization>Delta</organization>.
   <person>Otten</person> said the problem developed when the optical sensor located
an object, looked away, and then tried to relocate the original
object. By then, the target had moved beyond the range of the
sensor.
   The tracking test using the optical sensor was halted when the
fuel budgeted for that exercise became exhausted, <person>Otten</person> said.
   He said an infrared sensor also failed to function properly, but
infrared data was collected by a back-up system.
   <person>Otten</person> said only about <percent>three percent</percent> of the data collected during
the 12-hour mission of <organization>Delta</organization> 181 has been examined.

   The <organization>Marine Corps</organization> and the <organization>State Department</organization> on
<date>Friday</date> minimized a report that more than 500 instances of possible
wrongdoing by <organization>Marine</organization> guards at embassies worldwide had not been
investigated properly.
   ``Many of the so-called `infractions' were very minor, such as
curfew violations, insubordination, and misuse of telephone that
could have no conceivable tie to suspected <organization>KGB</organization> activity,'' the
corps said in a statement. The <organization>KGB</organization> is the Soviet spy agency.
   Both agencies responded to Rep. <person>Dan Mica</person>'s statement that more
than 500 reports of infractions by <organization>Marines</organization> at embassies had
remained in the <organization>State Department</organization>'s files until recently.
   <person>Mica</person>, D-<location>Fla.</location>, said the reports, which dealt with black market
activities or fraternization with Soviets, are supposed to be
turned over to the <organization>Naval Investigative Service</organization> for further
investigation.
   <person>Mica</person> said his information came from the <organization>General Accounting
Office</organization>, the congressional watchdog agency, which began looking into
security at the embassies in the wake of allegations of espionage
at the <location>Moscow</location> embassy.
   The <organization>KGB</organization> often encourages people to engage in illegal behavior as
a first step to gaining cooperation with the Soviets, <person>Mica</person> said.
   A <organization>State Department</organization> official, speaking on condition he remain
anonymous, said the decision to turn over information about a
possible violation by a <organization>Marine</organization> guard is sometimes made by the
<organization>Marines</organization>, sometimes by the department.
   ``There have been instances where one or both passed'' along
information to the <person>NIS</person>, the official said. The removal of a <organization>Marine</organization>
is also a joint decision, he said.
   Asked about the 578 reports referred to by <person>Mica</person>, the corps said,
``The report is actually a listing of the <organization>Marine</organization> security guards
whose tours of duty as <organization>embassy</organization> guards were cut short for a variety
of reasons during the period <date>1980</date>-<date>1987</date>.''
   Some <organization>Marines</organization> were removed for disciplinary reasons; others for
medical reasons or for giving a substandard performance, the
statement said.
   Of the security guards sent home between <date>1985</date>-<date>1987</date> ``only a
handful could be said to relate to espionage.'' During that period,
only one <organization>Marine</organization>, Sgt. <person>Clayton Lonetree</person>, has been convicted of
espionage for his activities in <location>Moscow</location>.
   The <organization>Marines</organization> said they had not known about the list of 578 until
<date>June 1987</date> ``when it surfaced at the <organization>Department of State</organization>.''
   <person>Mica</person> was not available to comment because he is in <location>Florida</location>
preparing to announce his candidacy for <organization>U.S. Senate</organization>. But his
spokesman, <person>John Gersuk</person>, said infractions on the list could have
been things other than black marketeering or fraternization
violations.
   <person>Mica</person> has said the various agencies' procedures for handling
potential security problems are chaotic and may need to be
overhauled.

   The <organization>Hotel del Coronado</organization>, a lavish
Victorian seaside resort with a star-studded past, will celebrate
its centennial next weekend with an extravangaza befitting its most
gilded days.
   Built in <date>1888</date> for <money>$1 million</money>, the hotel is one of the world's
largest wooden structures and the nation's only working commercial
hotel with a national monument designation.
   <organization>Famous</organization> for its Queen Anne design, the <organization>Del</organization>, as the hotel is known
locally, has served as host to 10 presidents, royalty from around
the world and countless celebrities.
   Businessman <person>Montgomery Ward</person>, actors <person>Charlie Chaplin</person> and <person>Mary
Pickford</person>, and President <person>Abraham Lincoln</person>'s son, <person>Robert Todd</person>, are
among those who signed its registry. <person>Thomas Edison</person> was the
five-story hotel's lighting technician.
   The picturesque resort of red-roofed turrets atop a white
gingerbread exterior on a peninsula south of <location>San Diego</location> also has
been a backdrop for a number of films and television shows.
   ``The <organization>Hotel Del</organization> is something fantastic,'' said silent screen
star <person>Anita Paige</person>, who stayed at the hotel while filming ``The
<organization>Flying Fleet</organization>'' in <date>1927</date>. ``I've been to <location>Europe</location> since and their only
competition is in <location>France</location>.''
   A posh weekend party celebrating the 100th birthday of the
wooden castle's <date>Feb. 19, 1888</date>, opening begins <date>Friday</date> night.
   Some 750 guests, including dozens of celebrities and movie
stars, have paid <money>$5,000</money> a couple to participate in the full
weekend. Proceeds will be donated to charity.
   At <date>Friday</date> night's festivities for 2,000, a disc jockey
resembling a hip <location>Edison</location> will spin records in one room as musicians
and dancers perform in others.
   <person>Marilyn Monroe</person> look-alikes and original <person>Munchkins</person> from the movie
``The Wizard of Oz'' will wander the paneled hallways. The film
``Some Like it Hot,'' starring Miss <person>Monroe</person>, <person>Jack Lemmon</person> and <person>Tony
Curtis</person>, was filmed on location at the hotel in <date>1958</date>, and <location>Oz</location> author
<person>L. Frank Baum</person>, a frequent hotel guest, allegedly based his book's
<location>Emerald City</location> on the <location>Del.</location>
   <date>Saturday</date> will feature a harbor tour with <location>America</location>'s Cup victor
<person>Dennis Conner</person>, a celebrity tennis tournament and a ball, followed
by a turn-of-the-century style picnic <date>Sunday</date> with hot air balloons
and a <organization>Navy</organization> air show.
   <person>Comedians George Burns</person> and <person>Phyllis Diller</person> will be among the
weekend's entertainers.
   But as current owner <person>Larry Lawrence</person> tells it, the hotel itself
nearly didn't make it to the party. When he bought the 399-room
hotel in <date>1963</date>, it had fallen prey to termites and neglect.
   ``There was no electricity in many places, no water above the
second floor,'' said <person>Lawrence</person>, the hotel's sixth owner. ``It was
infested with termites and rats. This was a property that had
everything but the bulldozer gutting it down.''
   More than <money>$40 million</money> later, the hotel stands with its
stateliness restored. It has new foundations, plumbing, heating,
electricity and an <money>$8 million</money> fire protection system.
   A steel frame was implanted to bolster the <organization>Crown Room</organization>, a
monumental dining room with a sugar pine ceiling that rises 33
feet. The hotel also was expanded.
   In <date>1970</date>, the <organization>Crown Room</organization> was the site of the largest state dinner
outside <location>Washington, D.C.</location>, with then-President <person>Richard Nixon</person>,
outgoing President <person>Lyndon Johnson</person>, Mexican President <person>Gustavo Diaz
Ordaz</person> and 800 others.
   Today, about half of the hotel's guests are corporate
executives. With 1,400 employees serving 700 suites, guests pay a
premium for service, <person>Lawrence</person> said. The hotel's average rate is
<money>$200</money> a day.
   It all began as a dream of railroad tycoon <person>Elisha Babcock</person> and
piano magnate H.L. Story, who envisioned while hunting on the
barren peninsula a resort that would be ``the talk of the Western
world.''
   It was designed by three brothers, former railroad architects
<person>James</person>, <person>Merritt</person> and <person>Watson Reid</person>, and built largely by unskilled
Chinese laborers. It became the largest structure outside of <location>New
York City</location> to be electrically lighted, powered by the first power
plant in <location>California</location>.

   Firefighters recovered the bodies of two people
<date>Friday</date> after a six-alarm blaze roared through an apartment complex,
causing more than <money>$1 million</money> in damage and leaving 200 people
homeless.
   Authorities have not determined the cause of the fire at
<person>Harvey</person>'s <organization>Racquet Apartments</organization>. All residents were accounted for.
   ``Firefighters found one adult and one child inside the building
and were still searching,'' <organization>Fire</organization> Capt. <person>Donna Cooper</person> said. The
victims were not immediately identified.
   Three others were slightly hurt, including one firefighter with
a knee injury.
   The fire destroyed or damaged 48 apartments, officials said.
About 120 firefighters battled the fast-moving fire at the
apartments near <location>Love Field</location> in 20-degree weather.
   Witnesses said some residents escaped from second and
third-floor apartments by climbing or jumping from
balcony-to-balcony.
   In addition to the those left homeless, another 100 residents
lost electricity because the power was cut for several hours.
   Complex employees and <organization>American Red Cross</organization> volunteers worked
through the night to find temporary housing for residents. Most
were temporarily housed in vacant apartments in other areas of the
complex.
   Fire officials said it was the largest blaze in <location>Dallas</location> since
<organization>flames</organization> swept through the <organization>Willow Creek</organization> Apartment complex five years
ago.

   <location>Iraq</location> said <date>Friday</date> its air defenses shot
down an unmanned Israeli surveillance plane over Iraqi territory
near the border with <location>Saudi Arabia</location>.
   In <location>Israel</location>, the military command said it had no information about
such an incident and an <organization>army</organization> spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said ``I believe we will not have any information.''
   The official <organization>Iraqi News Agency</organization>, monitored in <location>Cyprus</location>, quoted a
military statement as saying the remote-controlled aircraft was
``launched by the Zionists to jam Iraqi air defenses and monitor
data for the hireling (<person>Ayatollah Ruhollah</person>) <person>Khomeini</person> regime.''
   <location>Iraq</location> and <location>Iraq</location> are locked in a 7-year-old war and often accuse
each other of receiving Israeli aid.
   <location>Iraq</location> said its air defenses destroyed the craft at <time>5:44 p.m.</time>
<date>Thursday</date> near <location>Al Ma'aniyah</location>, a small outpost 185 miles southwest of
<location>Baghdad</location> on the Saudi-Iraqi border. It said the plane was launched
from the ``occupied Arab territories,'' a reference to <location>Israel</location> and
Israeli-occupied territories.
   The agency gave no further details. It did not say what weapons
were used to down the plane.
   In <location>Israel</location>, a senior military source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said, ``I think this report is rubbish.'' He expressed
doubt that an Israeli drone could reach Iraqi territory. It would
have to fly about 430 miles to get to <location>Al Ma'aniyah</location>.
   The report was believed to be the first of an Israeli intrusion
into Iraqi air space since Israeli jets destroyed an uncompleted
Iraqi nuclear power station in <date>1981</date>.
   <location>Israel</location> has pioneered development of radio-controlled
reconnaissance craft, but these have usually been used on
relatively short missions. The Israeli-made <organization>Pioneer</organization> unmanned
surveillance aircraft has a range of 115 miles. Two other
Israeli-made drones, the <organization>Scout</organization> and the <organization>Mastiff</organization>, have a range of 62
miles and 84 miles respectively.
   The craft look like oversized model airplanes. They carry
cameras, sometimes including TV cameras that help their distant
``pilots'' steer the craft to their objectives.
   The <location>United States</location> has been testing unmanned surveillance craft
in the <location>Persian Gulf</location>.

<HEAD>Governor Says `Yes' On Chrysler Lawsuit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. <person>Tommy G. Thompson</person> ordered attorneys
<date>Friday</date> to go ahead with a lawsuit against <organization>Chrysler Corp.</organization>, but held
out hope for a settlement that would preserve jobs at the <organization>Kenosha</organization>
plant the automaker wants to close.
   <person>Thompson</person> said <organization>Chrysler</organization> does not want a breach of contract suit
to be filed over its plan to lay off 5,500 auto workers at the
plant in <organization>Kenosha</organization>, which it acquired when it bought <organization>American Motors
Corp.</organization> last year, and has expressed a willingness to negotiate with
the state.
   ``It would be better for both parties to settle this case
quickly,'' <person>Thompson</person> said at a news conference.
   <person>Thompson</person> said <organization>Chrysler</organization> Chairman <person>Lee Iacocca</person> telephoned him
<date>Tuesday</date> and that a meeting was likely soon between state and
company oficials. He declined to say where or when it would be held.
   <organization>Chrysler</organization> announced <date>Jan. 27</date> it would halt production of the
<organization>Omni-Horizon</organization> autos <date>Sept. 30</date>.
   Attorney General <person>Don Hanaway</person> had advised the governor earlier
that the state had a ``clearly enforceable'' agreement with
<organization>Chrysler</organization> calling for <organization>Omni-Horizon</organization> autos to be built in <organization>Kenosha</organization> for
five years.
   At a news conference in <location>New York</location> last week, <person>Iacocca</person> defended his
company's decision to close the aging <organization>Kenosha</organization> plant.``We did not
lie to anybody,'' he said. ``Why would we?''
   <person>Hanaway</person> said the state has a ``good faith basis'' for filing the
suit. And even though no contract with <organization>Chrysler</organization> was signed, ``I
don't consider this to be frivolous in any way,'' he said.
   In <location>Chicago</location>, <organization>Chrysler Motors</organization> Chairman <person>Gerald Greenwald</person> said
company officials were sorry the <organization>Kenosha</organization> plant had to be closed.
   ``I guess you could say <organization>Chrysler</organization> was overly optimistic'' when it
told workers and government officials in <location>Wisconsin</location> that it believed
it could build the <organization>Omni-Horizon</organization> small car at <organization>Kenosha</organization> for up to five
years, <person>Greenwald</person> said.
   ``But we never lied to anyone and we believe there are no
grounds for a lawsuit claiming we did lie,'' he said. ``We never
made any hard commitments.''
   <person>Greenwald</person> said <organization>Chrysler</organization> always said market conditions would
dictate the future of the plant.
   <person>Greenwald</person> said <organization>Chrysler</organization> would repay the city and county of
<organization>Kenosha</organization> more than <money>$1 million</money> the governments spent on improvements
for the plant.
   During <person>Greenwald</person>'s news conference, about 50 <location>Wisconsin</location>
autoworkers picketed for hours in icy slush and 10-degree weather
outside his hotel to protest the <organization>Kenosha</organization> closing.
   Outside, workers carried signs bearing slogans such as: ``1st in
Quality, 1st to <person>Close</person>;'' ``Work Hard, Get Worked Over;'' and ``<person>Lee</person>
is a Liar,'' referring to <organization>Chrysler</organization> chairman <person>Lee Iacocca</person>, who
appears in television ads asking customers to trust <organization>Chrysler</organization>.

<HEAD>Senators Ask Gorbachev To Allow Baltic National Demonstrations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <organization>Thirty-two Senators</organization> have written to <organization>Kremlin</organization>
leader <person>Mikhail S. Gorbachev</person> asking him not to interfere with
demonstrations and religious services scheduled this <date>Sunday</date> and
<date>Tuesday</date> in the Soviet republics of <location>Lithuania</location> and <location>Estonia</location>, it was
announced <date>Friday</date>.
   The senators wrote <person>Gorbachev</person> ``to urge you not only to allow the
Lithuanian and Estonian people to peacefully honor their national
independence days, but also to take all necessary measures to
guarantee that they do not become targets of state-sponsored
harassment before or after these commemorations.''
   The state-controlled Soviet news media has criticized similar
congressional statements in the past for inciting public
demonstrations in the Baltic republics.
   The latest congressional letter, co-sponsored by Sens. <person>Donald
Riegle</person>, D-<location>Mich.</location>, <person>David Durenberger</person>, R-<location>Minn.</location>, and <person>Frank Lautenberg</person>,
D-<location>N.J.</location>, praised <person>Gorbachev</person> for not interfering with demonstrations
by an estimated 10,000 people in the three Baltic republics last
<date>Aug. 23</date>.
   Those demonstrations marked the anniversary of the <date>1939</date>
Molotov-Ribbentrop pact under which <person>Stalin</person> agreed to allow <person>Hitler</person>
to invade western <location>Poland</location> and <person>Hitler</person> allowed <person>Stalin</person> to invade
eastern <location>Poland</location>, <location>Lithuania</location>, <location>Latvia</location> and <location>Estonia</location>.
   For years, the citizens of <location>Estonia</location> and <location>Lithuania</location> have
celebrated, within the privacy of their homes, their pre-Soviet
independence days in <date>February</date>.
   The public demonstrations in the Baltic republics last <date>August</date>
came in response to <person>Gorbachev</person>'s policies of greater openness, and
brought warnings from two conservative members of the ruling
<organization>Politburo</organization>, <person>Viktor Chebrikov</person>, chairman of the <organization>KGB</organization> security police,
and <person>Yegor Ligachev</person>, the <organization>Communist Party</organization>'s chief ideologist, that
things were getting out of hand.
   The <location>U.S.</location> senators wrote <person>Gorbachev</person> that they had received reports
from emigre groups ``that 200 Lithuanians have written a letter
informing you of their intention to commemorate their independence
day on <date>Feb. 16</date> with flower-laying ceremonies.''
   Religious services also have been scheduled <date>Sunday</date> to mark the
pre-Soviet national day in <location>Lithuania</location>, which remains overwhelmingly
Roman Catholic after nearly 50 years of rule by the officially
atheistic <organization>Kremlin</organization> authorities.
   The senators said ``one report reaching the West indicates that
Soviet authorities may move to block these peaceful ceremonies.''
They cited a report of the beating in <location>Vilnius</location> on <date>Feb. 6</date> of <person>Nijole
Sadunaite</person>, a leading Lithuanian dissident, ``in an apparent attempt
to intimidate her.''
   The Lithuanian <organization>Information Center</organization>, an emigre organization with
offices in <location>Washington</location> and <location>New York</location>, blamed the beating on
plainclothes <organization>KGB</organization> officers.
   The letter cited concern over ``official harassment and abuse''
against demonstrators and cited as an ominous warning a report in
the <organization>Communist Party</organization> daily <organization>Pravda</organization> on <date>Jan. 29</date> that Lithuanian
authorities ``had decided to intensify their efforts against
`bourgeois nationalsim and clerical extremism.''
   The senators signing the letter, besides <person>Riegle</person>, <person>Lautenberg</person> and
<person>Durenberger</person>, were: <person>Brock Adams</person>, D-<location>Wash.</location>; <person>Rudy Boschwitz</person>, R-<location>Minn.</location>;

<HEAD>NEA: Teachers Snaring Delegate Slots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <organization>National Education Association</organization> said <date>Friday</date>
its teachers turned out in force in the <location>Iowa</location> caucuses and are
poised to grab a large share of <location>New Hampshire</location>'s Democratic
convention delegate slots.
   The union said 10,000 members turned out for the Republican and
Democratic <location>precinct</location> caucuses in <location>Iowa</location> last <date>Monday</date>, or <percent>30 percent</percent>
more than in <date>1984</date>.
   In <location>New Hampshire</location>, <organization>NEA</organization> members turned out in big numbers for
pre-primary caucuses held <date>Jan. 23</date> to determine who would run on
candidates' delegates slates.
   The union, in its weekly political newsletter, boasted that its
members snared more than <percent>25 percent</percent> of the slots on the Democratic
candidates' slates in <location>New Hampshire</location>.
   The liberal union sent several hundred delegates to the last
Democratic convention and several dozen to the Republican
convention. It has refrained so far from endorsing any one
candidate.
   But it has called all the Democrats acceptable and encouraged
state affiliates to maximize the number of teachers running for
delegate under any banner.

<HEAD>Dole Fails to File Full Slate in New York</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <location>New York</location> Rep. <person>Jack Kemp</person> apparently has
failed to file full delegate slates in his home state.
   The state <organization>Board of Elections</organization> said <date>Friday</date> that only Vice
President <person>George Bush</person> filed nominating petitions for delegates in
all congressional delegates, according to a preliminary count.
   Petitions for delegates slates in <location>New York</location>'s <date>April 19</date> primary
had to be postmarked by <time>midnight</time> <date>Thursday</date>.
   Polls have shown <person>Bush</person> with a solid lead in <location>New York</location> state and
his delegate supporters were expected to be on the ballot in all 34
of <location>New York</location>'s congressional districts.
   <person>Pat Robertson</person>'s <location>New York</location> campaign director, <person>Henry Hewes</person>, has
said he expected the former television preacher to have delegates
on the ballot in 20-28 congressional districts.
   <person>Kemp</person>'s <location>New York</location> campaign director <person>Timothy Carey</person> and <location>New York</location> for
<organization>Dole</organization> director <person>Philip Pepe</person> said they expected their candidates to
have delegates on the ballots in 20-22 districts.
   At the primary, Republican voters will pick 102 delegates, three
from each of the state's 34 congressional districts, to the
convention. The <organization>Republican State Committee</organization> will choose 34 at-large
delegates after the primary to round out <location>New York</location>'s 136-member
delegation at the <organization>GOP</organization> convention in <location>New Orleans</location>.

<HEAD>Babbitt Wins Gold Star on Environmental Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential hopeful <person>Bruce
Babbitt</person>'s environmental record won him the gold star in a report
card issued <date>Friday</date> by a national environmental watchdog group.
   The <organization>League of Conservation Voters</organization> praised <person>Babbitt</person> and Republican
presidential hopeful <person>Pete du Pont</person> for their stands on the
environment, while criticizing several other candidates, notably
Rep. <person>Jack Kemp</person>.
   The report gave the former <location>Arizona</location> governor high marks for his
stands on air pollution, acid rain, land management and knowledge
of worldwide problems such as depletion of the ozone layer and rain
forests.
   Also scoring well among the <organization>Democrats</organization> were <person>Tennesee</person> Sen. <person>Albert
Gore</person> and <location>Illinois</location> Sen. <person>Paul Simon</person>, with <location>Missouri</location> Rep. <person>Richard
Gephardt</person> getting the most lukewarm reception for votes on water and
population issues.
   Among <organization>Republicans</organization>, <person>du Pont</person>'s record in <organization>Congress</organization> on water
pollution, toxic waste cleanup and population issues won him the
league's highest score.
   League Chairman <person>Brent Blackwelder</person> slammed several <organization>Republicans</organization>,
particularly <person>Kemp</person> and Vice President <person>George Bush</person>, for their records
and unwillingness to respond to questionnaires about their
environmental views.
   ``<person>Kemp</person>'s record has gotten markedly worse in our last two
charts, and the <percent>50 percent</percent> grade we gave <person>Bush</person> is probably better
than some of his recent statements might suggest,'' <person>Blackwelder</person>
said.

<TEXT>
   A psychiatrist may be barred from conducting
federally sanctioned drug testing because of alleged inaccuracies
he published regarding an experimental treatment for Alzheimer's
disease.
   Dr. <person>William K. Summers</person> of <location>Arcadia</location>, <location>Calif.</location>, received the warning
last month in a letter from the <organization>Food and Drug Administration</organization> that
involved his account of preliminary studies on
tetrahydroaminocrydine, or <organization>THA</organization>, for combating the degenerative
mental illness.
   After the <organization>New England Journal of Medicine</organization> published <person>Summers</person>'
paper in <date>November 1986</date>, a public outcry arose for wider testing of
the drug, which <person>Summers</person> said was very promising.
   The <organization>FDA</organization> subsequently approved such broader testing, only to
suspend it late last year because of an unanticipated number of
side effects. The test procedures were redrawn and clinical trials
allowed to resume last month.
   <person>Summers</person> submitted his findings on the Alzheimer's drug to the
<organization>FDA</organization> five days after their publication in the <organization>New England journal</organization>.
   The <organization>FDA</organization> letter to <person>Summers</person> noted that the journal article was
submitted as part of his official report to the <organization>FDA</organization> and said
``there are numerous statements in your <organization>NEJM</organization> article that appear to
be false.''
   ``We believe that you have repeatedly or deliberately violated
regulations pertaining to the proper conduct of clinical testing of
investigational drugs,'' said the letter from Dr. <person>Frances O.
Kelsey</person>, director of an <organization>FDA</organization> division that oversees compliance with
agency research procedures. It said he may be barred from
performing sanctioned tests in the future.
   The letter asked <person>Summers</person> to explain 14 specific instances where
the <organization>FDA</organization> found evidence of misinformation. It said those ``are not a
comprehensive compilation of findings, but represent the more
significant regulatory violations that remain unexplained.''
   One of the 14 charges said <person>Summers</person> failed to report that eight
patients in his study also were taking other drugs that could
affect mental functioning, along with <organization>THA</organization>.
   Another said he failed to report that 10 of the 12 patients in
one phase of his study lived more than 2,000 miles from his office
and ``that medical monitoring was erratic and conducted mainly
through telephone contacts and letters with either family members
who had a variety of perceptions or local physicians who, you
concede, often did not follow your research protocol.''
   A third charge questioned what the <organization>FDA</organization> said is <person>Summers</person>'
subsequent acknowledgement that some of the study statistics he
submitted were reconstructed from memory.
   ``It does not seem plausible that you precisely remembered
multiple observations of the entire patient population without a
written record,'' the agency said.
   <person>Summers</person> relayed word through his answering service <date>Friday</date> that
he was not accepting telephone inquires about the subject. He has
several informal and formal procedures available to him to defend
his testing practices to the <organization>FDA</organization>.
   The <organization>FDA</organization> letter was disclosed initially in a story in <date>Friday</date>'s
<organization>New York Times</organization>.
   The <organization>FDA</organization> has not released the letter, but <organization>The Associated Press</organization>
obtained a copy from another government source. That source, who
asked to remain anonymous, said <person>Summers</person> has replied in writing to
the <organization>FDA</organization> but declined to release a copy of the response.

<DATELINE>EVESHAM, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A convicted <location>IRA</location> bomber serving a life
sentence married his American sweetheart <date>Friday</date> in a simple
ceremony in the prison chapel.
   <person>Paul Hill</person>, 33, has been imprisoned for 14 years for bombings
that killed seven people in <location>England</location> and injured <date>85</date>. He says he is
innocent and is hoping his conviction will be overturned by a new
police inquiry.
   <person>Hill</person> was allowed to chat briefly with his bride, <person>Marion
Severelli</person> of <location>New Jersey</location>, after the short ceremony conducted by a
Roman Catholic chaplain at <organization>Long Lartin Jail</organization>, 110 miles northwest of
<location>London</location>.
   He was then returned to his cell. But he was allowed to
celebrate with his bride and about 15 guests at a brief reception
later during which the couple cut a wedding cake.
   A <organization>prison</organization> spokesman said no alcohol was served and the couple
remained under the watchful eye of prison officers.
   Ms. <person>Severelli</person>, a buyer for a paper mill, first wrote to Hill
three years ago with news that a friend of his had died. After a
year of writing, she flew to <location>Britain</location> to meet him.
   ``When I first saw him, he was just about everything I thought
he would be _gentle and feeling,'' she said. ``He is not at all
cynical even though he is not guilty and has been locked up for
almost 14 years.''
   Ms. <person>Severelli</person> said she is convinced her husband is innocent and
hopes he will be able to join her in the <location>United States</location> if he is
ever released.
   She did not give her age or hometown and the information was not
immediately available from prison officials.
   Bombs exploded in <date>October 1974</date> in two pubs in the town of
<location>Guildford</location> near <location>London</location>, killing four soldiers and a civilian and
injuring about 50 other people. The following month, a bomb blew up
in a pub in the <location>London</location> district of <person>Woolwich</person>, killing two people and
injuring 35 others. All three pubs were frequented by military
personnel.
   Responsibility for the bombings was claimed by the <organization>Irish
Republican Army</organization>. The group is fighting to end British rule in
Protestant-dominated <location>Northern Ireland</location> and unite the province with
the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic <location>Irish Republic</location>.
   <person>Hill</person> was one of four people convicted of the pub bombings. The
so-called <organization>Guildford Four</organization> have always maintained their innocence.
   Last <date>July</date>, <organization>Home</organization> Secretary <person>Douglas Hurd</person> ordered a police inquiry
into the bombings after receiving statements from a delegation led
by Cardinal <person>Basil Hume</person>, head of the <organization>Roman Catholic Church</organization> in
<location>England</location> and <location>Wales</location>, that expressed concern about the verdicts.
   Ms. <person>Severelli</person> said she and her husband had discussed the
possibility that he might spend the rest of his life in jail, but
they decided last <date>spring</date> to get married anyway.
   ``I don't know if he will get justice in a British court. But I
believe that good will triumph,'' she was quoted as telling The
<organization>Guardian</organization> newspaper on <date>Friday</date>.
   Ms. <person>Severelli</person> has been staying at the <location>Evesham Prison</location> Visitor
<organization>Center</organization> to meet the residential qualification for the wedding. She
is expected to return to the <location>United States</location> next week.

   <organization>The Environmental Protection Agency</organization> said
<date>Friday</date> it had begun a special review of the insecticide dichlorvos,
which is used in fly-killing pest strips and many other

   The agency said studies on laboratory animals show the chemical

   Some 2 million pounds of dichlorvos are used in about 800
products every year. About <percent>25 percent</percent> is used on farm crops, <percent>35

   <person>Dichlorvos</person> has been used since <date>1948</date> against flies, mosquitoes,
gnats, cockroaches and other insects.
   Last <date>Septmeber</date>, the agency ordered new label warnings and
restrictions on commercial use of most products to state-certified
applicators, but did not restrict home and pet products. Workers
are supposed to keep out of commercial and agricultural areas for

   <organization>EPA</organization>'s special reviews can lead to fewer or more restrictions, a
ban on the product or its exoneration. The agency tries to complete
the reviews in 12 months to 15 months.

<HEAD>Angola Rejects South African Proposal for Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <location>Angola</location> has rejected a South African
proposal for a regional peace conference that would include <organization>Angolan</organization>
rebels, <location>Angola</location>'s official <organization>ANGOP</organization> news agency reported <date>Friday</date>.
   It quoted a government statement as saying <location>Angola</location> was prepared
to hold direct peace talks with <location>South Africa</location> if that country
rejected the <location>United States</location> as a mediator.
   But the Marxist government rejected any negotiations that would
include rebels of the <organization>National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola</organization> (<organization>UNITA</organization>), according to the report monitored in <location>Lisbon</location>.
   It quoted the statement as saying, ``The reference to the
participation of <organization>UNITA</organization> removes all credibility from the South
African government's proposal.''
   It also claimed the proposal was a maneuver aimed at gaining
time to increase South African military pressure on government
forces in southern <location>Angola</location>.
   President <person>P.W. Botha</person> of <location>South Africa</location> said last month he was
willing to participate in a regional meeting to resolve conflicts
in southern <location>Africa</location> and that <organization>UNITA</organization> should be represented.
   <person>Botha</person> has not specifically proposed a peace conference or put
forward any concrete suggestions.
   <organization>Anti-communist UNITA</organization> guerrillas have been battling the
government since the Marxists gained power following <location>Angola</location>'s
independence from <location>Portugal</location> in <date>1975</date>.
   The rebels are backed by <location>South Africa</location> and receive aid from the
<location>United States</location>. An estimated 40,000 Cuban military personnel and
Soviet advisers are helping the government forces.
   South African troops have made frequent incursions into southern
<location>Angola</location> from neighboring <location>South-West Africa</location>, also known as <location>Namibia</location>.
   <location>Angola</location>, in its statement that rejected any talks with <organization>UNITA</organization>,
said it would be ``coherent and logical'' to include in a regional
conference the <organization>South-West African People's Organization</organization> (SWAPO) and
the <organization>African National Congress</organization>.
   The <organization>African National Congress</organization> is the main rebel movement
fighting <location>South Africa</location>'s white-led government and <organization>SWAPO</organization> is a black
guerrilla group fighting for independence for <location>Namibia</location>, which is
administered by <location>South Africa</location>.
   <organization>ANGOP</organization> quoted the Angolan statement as saying the main causes of
confict in the region are <location>South Africa</location>'s ``illegal occupation'' of
<location>Namibia</location>, South African attacks against its black-ruled neighbors
and its alleged creation of armed groups to carry out ``terrorist
activities'' in those countrie, and the denial of political rights
to the black majority in <location>South Africa</location>.
   Later <date>Friday</date>, the <organization>Angolan Embassy</organization> in <location>Lisbon</location> issued a statement
denying reports published in <location>Portugal</location> that representatives of the
Angolan government and <organization>UNITA</organization> would hold peace talks this summer in
<location>Lisbon</location>.

   <location>PORT-AU-PRINCE</location>, <location>Haiti</location> (<organization>AP</organization>) _ <organization>Parliament</organization> gave unanimous approval
<date>Friday</date> to Prime Minister <person>Martial Celestin</person>'s 14-member <organization>Cabinet</organization>,
which includes a member of the former ruling <organization>junta</organization> as defense
minister.
   No one identified as a <person>Duvalier</person> supporter is in the <organization>Cabinet</organization> but
the new defense minister, Brig. Gen <person>William Regala</person>, is not popular.
Critics repeatedly demanded his resignation during the two years of
<organization>junta</organization> rule after dictator <person>Jean-Claude Duvalier</person> fled the country
<date>Feb. 7, 1986</date>.
   <person>Celestin</person> kept the portfolio of justice minister. <person>Gerard
Philippe-Auguste</person>, a former presidential candidate, is minister of
agriculture.
   President <person>Leslie Manigat</person> and his prime minister appeared to be
trying through the <organization>Cabinet</organization> appointments to broaden popular support
for their government. Most of the members are known as liberals or
moderates.
   <person>Manigat</person> was declared the winner of the <date>Jan. 17</date> election, which
was run by the junta, boycotted by the most popular presidential
candidates and ignored by most Haitians.
   <person>Philippe-Auguste</person>, an agronomist, was one of the four main
candidates <date>Jan. 17</date>. He and the other two who lost to <person>Manigat</person>
claimed the army rigged the vote in <location>Manigat</location>'s favor.
   An election in <date>November</date> managed by an independent <organization>Electoral
Council</organization> was called off within hours because bands of thugs, often
joined by soldiers, killed at least 34 people and wounded <date>75</date>.
   Among the other <organization>Cabinet</organization> members are:
   _Gerard <person>Latortue</person>, foreign affairs. <person>Latortue</person>, 54, spent 25 years
in exile during the three decades of <person>Duvalier</person> dictatorship and was
co-director of the <organization>U.N. Organization for Industrial Development</organization> in
<location>Vienna</location>.
   <person>_Adrien Westerband</person>, public health. He is director of the <organization>Haitian
Red Cross</organization>.
   <person>_Emmanuel Fils Aime</person>, education and sports. <person>Fils Aime</person> was
education minister for two months in <date>1985</date> and is the only new
<organization>Cabinet</organization> minister to have held a public position under <person>Jean-Claude</person>
or his father, <person>Francois</person> (Papa <person>Doc) Duvalier</person>.
   <person>_Alain Turnier</person>, finance. He is an industrialist and writer in
his early 70s who was finance minister under Gen. <person>Paul Magloire</person>,
the president before the elder <person>Duvalier</person> gained power in <date>1957</date>.

   Four leaders of the leftist terrorist group <organization>Direct

   <person>Jean-Marc Rouillan</person>, <person>Nathalie Menigon</person>, <person>Joelle Aubron</person> and <person>Georges

later on more serious charges, including murder.
   The two men and two women were brought to court in wheelchairs.
They are being held at <organization>Fresnes Prison</organization>'s hospital in the <location>Paris</location>
suburbs.
   Fifteen other <organization>Direct Action</organization> members were tried with the leaders,
including one tried in absentia. Eleven were convicted of belonging
to a criminal organization and given penalties ranging from
suspended sentences to 10 years in prison.
   Two women were acquitted. A man and a woman were convicted on
the lesser charge of brigandage and were given 18-month suspended
sentences.
   Defendants had frequently interrupted the two-week trial with
shouts and demonstrations. The trial was concluded <date>Jan. 21</date> in the
<organization>14th Correctional Chamber of the Tribunal</organization> of <location>Paris</location>.
   Direct Action surfaced in <date>1979</date>, claiming responsibility for
bombings and attacks on public buildings which at first caused no
casualties.
   Later, <organization>Direct Action</organization> claimed responsibility for killing Gen.
<person>Rene Audran</person>, a French arms sales official, in <date>1985</date>, and <person>Georges
Besse</person>, president of the state-owned <organization>Renault</organization> automobile company, in
<date>1986</date>.
   After a series of arrests last year, police said they believed
that all leaders of the group were in custody.

   <location>Romania</location> allowed a citizen employed as a <organization>U.N.</organization>
disarmament official to return to his job and family in <location>Geneva</location> on
<date>Friday</date> after keeping him in his communist homeland for more than
two years.
   <person>Liviu Bota</person>, who headed the <organization>U.N. Institute for Disarmament
Research</organization> in <location>Geneva</location>, said an ``error'' by <organization>Romanian</organization> authorities
prevented him from returning after he was summoned home in <date>December
1985</date> for ``urgent consultations.''
   Speaking to reporters at the airport <date>Friday</date> night, he would not
speculate on why he was let go, but said: ``It was an error made at
some level and it's over now. I'm very happy to be back in <location>Geneva</location>.''
   He said pressure by <organization>U.N.</organization> Secretary-General <person>Javier Perez de
Cuellar</person> and others had helped.
   In <location>New York</location>, <person>Mario Zamorano</person>, a spokesman for <person>Perez de Cuellar</person>,
said: ``The secretary-general, on behalf of all the <organization>U.N.</organization> staff
members, is very pleased'' about <person>Bota</person>'s return.
   <person>Bota</person> will retain a director-level post but his disarmament job
has been taken over by another official, <organization>U.N.</organization> spokeswoman <person>Therese
Gastaut</person> said.
   He was met by his wife <person>Sandra</person> and <person>Jan Martenson</person>, director of the
<organization>U.N.</organization> office in <location>Geneva</location>.
   Mrs. <person>Bota</person> has claimed Romanian authorities put her husband under
round-the-clock surveillance, following him with two cars and
tapping or periodically cutting off his telephone.
   <organization>Romanian</organization> officials played ``deaf and dumb,'' insisting that <person>Bota</person>
had no legal ties with the <organization>United Nations</organization> or that his <organization>U.N.</organization> contract
was not valid, she said in a written statement published in <location>Geneva</location>
last month.
   <organization>U.N.</organization> officials intensified efforts on <person>Bota</person>'s behalf after his
wife took an overdose of tranquilizers and other pills in <date>May 1986</date>.
<person>Perez de Cuellar</person> made repeated demands for his release, and the
case also was on the <location>U.S.</location> human rights agenda.
   <person>John C. Whitehead</person>, deputy secretary of state, met with <person>Bota</person> last
week during a visit to <location>Romania</location>. <organization>State Department</organization> officials would
not say whether <person>Whitehead</person> had a role in the release.
   When he was called home <person>Bota</person> had been a <organization>U.N.</organization> official for 13
years, on loan from his government, and had headed the disarmament
institute since <date>1980</date>.
   President <person>Nicolae Ceausescu</person>'s government later told the <organization>United
Nations</organization> that <person>Bota</person> was resigning his disarmanent post, but <organization>U.N.</organization>
officials refused to accept the resignation unless it was submitted
in person.
   He was not allowed to do so and the Romanian government later
accused him of espionage.
   There have been other cases in which <organization>U.N.</organization> officials from the
Soviet bloc were detained during visits to their homelands and <organization>U.N.</organization>
intervention had no effect.
   One of the most publicized cases was that of <person>Alicja Wesolowska</person>,
a <organization>U.N.</organization> secretary in <location>New York</location> who was detained on a visit to <location>Poland</location>.
She was sentenced to seven years in prison in <date>1979</date> on charges of
spying for a <organization>NATO</organization> nation that was not identified.
   <person>Percy Stultz</person>, an East German employe of the <location>Paris</location>-based <organization>U.N.
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization</organization>, was arrested in
<date>March 1980</date> while visiting his country and convicted of
``anti-state'' activities.
   Both Ms. <person>Wesolowska</person> and <person>Stultz</person> eventually were freed from
prison, but both have been confined to their contries.

<HEAD>Dollar Jumps on Trade Report, Gold Mostly Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar soared in value <date>Friday</date> against most
major currencies around the world after the government reported
that the <location>U.S.</location> trade deficit shrank for the second consecutive month
in <date>December</date>.
   Gold prices rose. At <organization>Republic National Bank</organization> in <location>New York</location>, the
late bid for the precious metal was <money>$445.50</money> a troy ounce, up <money>$5</money>
from <date>Thursday</date>.
   ``We've got the excitement at last,'' said <person>James O'Neill</person>, an
economist and currency analyst for <organization>Marine Midland Bank</organization>. ``Within 30
seconds that the trade numbers came out there was an immediate
adjustment (upward).''
   The <organization>Commerce Department</organization> said <date>Friday</date> that the nation's
merchandise trade shortfall shrank to <money>$12.2 billion</money> in <date>December</date>
from <money>$13.2 billion</money> in the previous month, as exports jumped <percent>4.2
percent</percent>.
   The <date>December</date> gap was the smallest since a <money>$11.9 billion</money> deficit
in <date>January 1987</date> and much lower than market analysts had predicted.
   The dollar had risen about <money>two yen</money> and it was up around <money>two
cents</money> against the <money>British pound</money> and the Swiss franc shortly after
the trade report was released, according to <person>O'Neill</person>.
   Later in the day, though, some profit-taking and a reluctancy to
hold dollar positions through the long <date>Washington's Birthday</date>
holiday weekend helped pushed the American currency off its highs,
traders said.
   ``Even though the numbers are good nobody wants to go home
sitting on dollars because all the old fears haven't dissipated,''
said <person>O'Neill</person>, ``those fears being that the trade deficit is still
too big and that the dollar may have to fall further to get rid of
it.''
   The dollar's protracted decline in value began more than two
years ago as a result of coordinated efforts by the <location>United States</location>
and its main trading partners to improve the <location>U.S.</location> trade picture and
avoid protectionist legislation. In in the past several weeks,
however, the dollar's value has been relatively stable.
   <person>Gary Dorsch</person>, senior money market analyst for <organization>LNS Financial Group
Inc.</organization>, said the dollar also was helped <date>Friday</date> by a rise in interest
rates in the credit markets. He said dealers believe the <organization>Federal
Reserve</organization> won't move to push rates lower in order to prevent the
<money>dollar</money> from falling.
   Rising interest rates tend to support a currency because they
attract foreign investors eager to buy higher-yielding <location>U.S.</location>
securities.
   The dollar rose above <money>130 Japanese yen</money> for the first time since
<date>mid-December</date>, trading at <money>131.15 yen</money> in <location>London</location> from 129.95 earlier

<HEAD>Judge Rules Against EPA in Pesticide Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <organization>Environmental Agency</organization> hasn't proven it can
legally authorize the retail sale of small amounts of the pesticide
chlordane as part of a deal to ultimately take the anti-termite
chemical off the market, a federal judge said <date>Friday</date>.
   The agency's latest court filing does not satisfy federal law
which requires the <organization>EPA</organization> to determine that a pesticide will not
unreasonably harm the environment, said <location>U.S.</location> District Judge <person>Louis
F. Oberdorfer</person>.
   The <organization>EPA</organization> believes that chlordane causes cancer. To avoid a
protracted battle with 197 distributors, the agency has agreed to
let them sell chlordane already in stock. In return, the companies
are argeeing to cancellation of their licenses to sell the
pesticide.
   <person>Oberdorfer</person>, however, said the <organization>EPA</organization> had produced no evidence to
back its assertion that distribution of remaining stocks won't
cause undue harm.
   The lawyer representing the <organization>EPA</organization>, <person>Steven Rogers</person>, argued that
insisting on the use of the procedures in the law would in the end
mean less environmental protection in this case because
distributors could fight the revocation of their licenses and
continue selling chlordane products during what could become
protracted hearings.
   The judge asked the <organization>National Coalition Against the Misuse of
Pesticides</organization> to submit a draft order declaring use of remaining
stocks of chlordane illegal, but he gave no indication of when he
might rule. The coalition and others have been seeking such an
order since <date>October</date>.
   It is unclear whether the order will make a difference. No one
knows how much chlordane distributors have, though the <organization>EPA</organization> says it
believes the amount is very small.
   The <organization>EPA</organization> concluded last year that excessive chlordane residues
can remain in a home even after proper application. Generally,
chlordane is injected under pressure into soil around the
foundation.
   The only manufacturer of chlordane, <organization>Velsicol Chemical Corp.</organization>, and
the <organization>EPA</organization> agreed last <date>August</date> that <person>Velsicol</person> would no longer sell it
while the company tries to come up with an acceptable application
method.
   The company and the <organization>EPA</organization> later agreed to end use of <person>Velsicol</person>'s
inventories, but the stocks of companies using chlordane in their
own products weren't covered by the agreement.
   After the hearing, <person>Bob Perliss</person>, an <organization>EPA</organization> lawyer working with
<person>Rogers</person>, said the companies had reported holding a total of about
1,700 pounds. This would be <percent>1.6 percent</percent> of the amount in <location>Velsicol</location>'s
hands in <date>August</date>, or a two-month supply at the then-prevalent usage
rates.

<TEXT>
   The head of the <location>U.S.</location> delegation to a
review of the <location>Helsinki</location> accords accused <location>Moscow</location> and its allies <date>Friday</date>
of hampering progress on a final document by stalling on human
rights issues.
   ``What we see now is that things are beginning either to level
off or in some cases to go backward,'' <person>Warren Zimmermann</person> said at
the third follow-up Conference on Security and <organization>Cooperation</organization> in
<location>Europe</location>.
   ``Textual obligations are festooned with loopholes that deprive
them of all force,'' <person>Zimmermann</person> told a plenary meeting, referring
to Soviet bloc draft proposals. ``For example, freedom of religion
must be consistent with public safety, order, health and morals.
Other freedoms are limited by national legislation.''
   <person>Zimmermann</person> told a news conference that in the three weeks since
the meeting resumed after a <date>Christmas</date> break he noticed ``a very
serious effort'' by the East bloc to put off an agreement.
   ``I hope it's tactical and I hope that it will change,'' he said.
   Delegates from 35 countries, including the <location>United States</location>, <location>Canada</location>
and all European nations except <location>Albania</location> have been meeting in <location>Vienna</location>
since <date>November 1986</date> to review compliance with the <date>1975</date> <location>Helsinki</location>
accords on military security, economic cooperation and humanitarian
issues.
   <person>Zimmermann</person> rejected Soviet bloc assertions that the West is
stressing humanitarian concerns at the expense of European
disarmament issues.
   ``We're not holding any element here hostage to any other
element,'' <person>Zimmermann</person> said.
   He also said the ``obstructionist'' approach of Soviet bloc
governments at the conference has been accompanied by
``disquieting'' signs of failure of those same governments to
observe <location>Helsinki</location> commitments at home.
   <person>Zimmermann</person> noted that a Soviet promise to release all
``religious prisoners'' in an amnesty last <date>November</date> was not kept
and the elimination of psychiatric abuse is still awaited ``despite
promises made as recently as yesterday.''
   He said he noticed similar human rights abuses in other bloc
countries, including <location>Romania</location> and <location>Czechoslovakia</location>.
   The concluding date of the conference has been postponed twice.
Before <date>Christmas</date>, diplomats set the deadline for <date>Easter</date> but some
Western dilopmats now say <date>summer</date> would be more realistic.
   The accords, or the <date>1975</date> <location>Helsinki</location> Final Act, include commitments
to honor human rights, individual freedoms, travel and other
exchanges among nations. The 35 signatory nations promised to honor
the covenant's provisions but the accords have no enforcement
mechanism.

   Angry tenants and a banner reading ``Welcome You
Reptile'' greeted a landlord <date>Friday</date> when he reported to one of his
buildings to serve a 15-day sentence of house arrest for failing to
correct housing violations.
   <person>Morris Gross</person>, 77, who lives in a luxury high-rise in the
<location>Brighton Beach</location> section of <location>Brooklyn</location>, will be confined to a
fifth-floor apartment in a building where tenants complain of bugs
and rodents, lack of heat and hot water, and leaky ceilings.
   His movements will be monitored by an electronic ankle bracelet
to make sure he serves his sentence.
   A judge convicted <person>Gross</person> of criminal and civil contempt in
<date>December</date> after the city <organization>Department of Housing Preservation and
Development</organization> brought action against him for failing to comply with a
court order to correct housing violations.
   He was fined <money>$32,000</money> for the contempt conviction and <money>$137,900</money> in
civil penalties. Judge <person>Ira Harkavy</person> gave him the option of spending
15 days under house arrest and putting the <money>$137,900</money> toward the cost
of correcting the 420 violations at the 113-unit building in the
<location>Flatbush</location> section of <location>Brooklyn</location>.
   Asked why <person>Gross</person> chose house arrest, his attorney, <person>Stanley
Kopilow</person>, said <person>Gross</person> ``wanted to show to the judge and the community
that this is not as bad as portrayed in the press.''
   Gross made no comment to the group of angry tenants who shouted
at him when he walked into the lobby <date>Friday</date> morning. The landlord,
whose meals will be catered, will have a private security guard
with him in the apartment during his sentence.
   ``We ask for so many things and they don't do anything,'' said
tenant <person>Errol Ramdeo</person>.
   He said the door to the apartment where he lives with his
parents is off its hinges, bathroom tiles are falling off the wall
and their stove doesn't work.
   <person>Joyce Stewart</person>, president of the tenants' association, took a
group of reporters on a tour to show them some of the violations.
She pointed out a large hole in the ceiling of one apartment from
which ``water comes down like crazy.''
   <person>Tenant Vivian Murray</person> complained of flaking paint chips, which
she has discovered her 2{-year-old daughter eating.
   <person>Lawrence Carelli</person>, the housing agency attorney who handled the
case, said there were still 400 outstanding violations in the
building, some dating back five years.
   Building superintendent Sydney Pilgrim said <person>Gross</person> had spent <money>$1
million</money> to repair the building.
   ``We know <person>Gross</person> is not an angel. We know he should not have let
the building run down so far, but work is getting done,'' <organization>Pilgrim</organization>
said.
   Ms. <person>Stewart</person> charged that cosmetic repairs had been done on only
10 to 12 apartments. ``When you subtract that from <money>113</money> apartments,
you'll see the real <person>McCoy</person>,'' she said.

<HEAD>MIA Remains Transported Without Informing Widow Due To Oversight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <organization>Navy</organization> acknowledged late <date>Friday</date> that ``due
to an oversight,'' the remains of a Vietnam War victim had been
transported from <location>Hawaii</location> to <location>California</location> this week without informing
the man's widow.
   The <organization>Navy</organization> and <organization>Pentagon</organization> also said they could not explain why a
request by the widow to withhold public announcement of a military
laboratory's identification of the remains had not been honored.
   The widow, <person>Erna McKinney</person> of <location>San Diego</location>, <location>Calif.</location>, said <date>Thursday</date> in
a telephone interview she had asked that the identification be
withheld because she wanted to obtain a second opinion to verify
the military's forensic work.
   Last <date>Tuesday</date>, the <organization>Pentagon</organization> announced the <organization>Army</organization>'s <organization>Central
Identification Laboratory</organization> in <location>Honolulu</location> had succeeded in identifying
six sets of remains repatriated to the <location>United States</location> from <location>Vietnam</location>.
   One of the six, the <organization>Pentagon</organization> said, had been identified as <organization>Navy</organization>
Lt. <person>Clemie McKinney</person>, an aviator who was lost over South <location>Vietnam</location> on
<date>April 14, 1972</date>. <person>McKinney</person>, who was 26, listed his home as <location>Cleveland</location>,
<location>Ohio</location>, at the time of his disappearance.
   ``I told them I didn't want them to release the identification
because I wasn't prepared to accept the finding; that I wanted a
second opinion,'' said Mrs. <person>McKinney</person>, who contacted reporters after
news stories about the <organization>Pentagon</organization>'s announcement appeared.
   ``And then they did it anyway. And then they're bringing in the
remains and nobody told me.''
   The remains of <person>McKinney</person> and the other five MIAs were transported
from <location>Hawaii</location> to <location>Travis Air Force Base</location>, <location>Calif.</location>, on <date>Thursday</date>.
   Since <person>McKinney</person> was a <organization>Navy</organization> officer, <organization>Navy</organization> officials were
responsible for dealing with his next-of-kin.
   Lt. Col. <person>Keith Schneider</person>, a <organization>Pentagon</organization> spokesman, said <date>Friday</date> that
<organization>Navy</organization> casualty assistance officers had earlier informed Mrs.
<person>McKinney</person> of the procedures that would be followed for transporting
the remains.
   ``Unfortunately, due to an oversight, the transportation
arrangements were not confirmed to her before the public
announcement,'' <person>Schneider</person> said after consulting with <organization>Navy</organization> officials.
   The spokesman said he did not know why Mrs. <person>McKinney</person>'s request
to withhold public announcement of the identification was not
honored.
   ``All I can say is that we routinely abide by the family's
desires on that point,'' <person>Schneider</person> said. ``If we had been aware of
that request here (at the <organization>Pentagon</organization>), we would have made sure the
identification was not released publicly.
   ``<person>Regretably</person>, there were misunderstandings or misinterpretations
in this case and we're now working with the family to remedy those.
We will work very closely with the next-of-kin to satisfy their
preferences and desires.''
   Mrs. <person>McKinney</person> said she wanted to have the remains moved to
another forensic scientist in <location>Colorado</location> for detailed examination.
   ``I'm not trying not to accept their identification,'' she said.
``I'm just not ready to accept some of their evidence. And that's
why I didn't want their identification announced yet.''
   Although the work of the <organization>Army</organization>'s laboratory has been verified for
the most part, there have been instances in which independent
scientists concluded the laboratory did not have sufficient
evidence to justify a finding of positive identification.

   President <person>Reagan</person> helped raise more than
<money>$500,000</money> in political funds <date>Friday</date> at a gathering of Republican
high-rollers, demonstrating he is still a big drawing card for the
<organization>GOP</organization>.
   The president and first lady <person>Nancy Reagan</person> were the featured
attraction at a reception at the <organization>Bel-Air</organization> mansion of
millionaire-businessman <person>David Murdock</person>.
   The affair behind the walls of <person>Murdock</person>'s spacious estate was
closed to reporters. Among the dignitaries seen entering were Sen.
<person>Pete Wilson</person>, R-<location>Calif.</location>, who is up for re-election this year, and
<location>California</location>'s Republican Gov. <person>George Deukmejian</person>.
   Before leaving the <organization>White House</organization>, the president was briefed by
<person>Colin Powell</person>, his national security adviser, about two <organization>U.S. Navy</organization>
warships being deliberately bumped by two Soviet warships in the
<location>Black Sea</location>.
   Sunny skies and warm temperatures greeted <person>Reagan</person> in <location>Los Angeles</location>,
in contrast to the fog and cold he left behind in <location>Washington</location>.
   More than 50 couples paid <money>$10,000</money> each to sip champagne and have
their picture taken with <person>Reagan</person> and his wife <person>Nancy</person> during their
45-minute appearance.
   The fund-raiser was <person>Reagan</person>'s only scheduled event in <location>California</location>.
On <date>Saturday</date>, he will fly to a <location>Pacific</location> resort of <location>Mazatlan</location>, <location>Mexico</location>,
for afternoon talks with President <person>Miguel de la Madrid</person>, then travel
to his mountaintop ranch near <location>Santa Barbara</location>, <location>Calif.</location>, for a
four-night stay.
   <person>Reagan</person>'s political director, <person>Frank Donatelli</person>, said that with
less than three weeks' notice, there was no trouble lining up
big-money contributors eager to mix with the president, who was
wounded by the <organization>Iran-Contra</organization> affair and has only 11 months left in
office.
   ``The president will always be able to be a good fund-raiser,''
<person>Donatelli</person> said.
   The money will go to the <organization>California Republican Party</organization>. <person>Reagan</person>
will hold another fund-raiser later this year to help the
re-election campaign of Sen. <person>Pete Wilson</person>, R-<location>Calif.</location>, <person>Donatelli</person> said.
   He said <location>California</location> is ``one of our top targets this year.'' With
its late primary, the state could play a decisive role in the
Republican presidential race. With 47 electoral votes at stake, the
most of any state, it will be a major battlefield for the <date>November</date>
election.
   ``A strong, well-financed <organization>Republican Party</organization> will be a benefit to
whoever the nominee is,'' <person>Donatelli</person> said.
   <person>Reagan</person>, at a gathering of Republican conservatives <date>Thursday</date>
night, pledged to ``campaign vigorously for whoever our nominee
is.''
   Reporters were excluded from the fund-raiser at the home of
<person>Murdock</person>, who lives on the estate once owned by the late hotel
magnate <person>Conrad</person> <organization>Hilton</organization>.
   A real estate tycoon, <person>Murdock</person> also is chairman of the <location>Los
Angeles</location>-based <organization>Castle &amp; Cooke Inc.</organization>, which has revenues of more than
<money>$1 billion</money> and is best known for its subsidiary, <organization>Dole Food Co.</organization>, the
pineapple and banana distributor.
   On <date>Saturday</date>, <person>Reagan</person> will meet with <person>de la Madrid</person> in <location>Mazatlan</location>, a
resort area troubled by drug-related violence.
   A senior administration official who briefed reporters in
advance of the <person>Reagan-de la Madrid</person> meeting said both <location>Mexico</location> and the
<location>United States</location> are critical of the other's handling of the drug
problem.
   ``The Mexican perception is that we are the world's largest
market for drugs _ cocaine, marijuana and heroin _ and that we are
not doing enough to reduce the consumption of dangerous drugs in
the <location>United States</location>,'' said the official, who spoke on condition he
not be identified.
   At the same time, he said, the administration believes <location>Mexico</location> is
making increasing, but still inadequate, efforts to fight drug
trafficking. ``The flow of drugs is increasing ... and, in our
view, the amount of the drug-related corruption is growing,'' he
said.

   <location>Ireland</location>'s prime minister said after a
chilly meeting with <person>Margaret Thatcher</person> on <date>Friday</date> he was not satified
with the British attitude in a dispute over police conduct in
<location>Northern Ireland</location>.
   British officials said the 30-minute meeting between Prime
Minister <person>Thatcher</person> and <person>Charles Haughey</person> of <location>Ireland</location> was ``calm and
dignified,'' but an Irish statement said <person>Haughey</person> ``could not regard
the present response of the British government in the areas of
principal concern as satisfactory.''
   The statement said <person>Haughey</person> was still waiting for ``an adequate
response'' to Irish protests made at an inter-governmental meeting
<date>Feb. 2</date>.
   <date>Friday</date>'s meeting was the first between the two leaders since
<location>Britain</location> acknowledged on <date>Jan. 25</date> that there was evidence of a
coverup after police in the British province killed six unarmed
Roman Catholics in three separate incidents in <date>1982</date>.
   <location>Britain</location> said there would be no prosecutions. There are fears the
affair could damage the <organization>Anglo-Irish Agreement</organization>, which is aimed at
bolstering the Catholic minority's confidence in British justice in
<location>Northern Ireland</location>.
   ``Mrs. <person>Thatcher</person> expressed her belief that the <organization>Anglo-Irish
Agreement</organization> must continue, as therein lies the future,'' a British
spokesman said after the meeting, referring to the <date>1985</date> pact giving
the Irish Republic a consultative role in <location>Northern Ireland</location> affairs.
He spoke on condition of anonymity following government practice.
   The killings of five Irish nationalist guerrillas and a
teen-ager prompted charges that police had a shoot-to-kill policy.
An investigation found no evidence of official shoot-to-kill
tactics, but said officers lied and tried to cover up their
practices.
   At <date>Friday</date>'s meeting, Mrs. <person>Thatcher</person> said the decision not to
prosecute was not influenced by her administration, since it was
made by the Director of <organization>Public Prosecutions</organization>, who is not a member of
the government.
   It was endorsed and announced, however, by <organization>Solicitor</organization>-General Sir
<person>Patrick Mayhew</person>, a <organization>Cabinet</organization> member. He said prosecutions would not
promote ``national security'' or be in the ``public interest.''
   Mrs. <person>Thatcher</person> promised <person>Haughey</person> that <person>Tom King</person>, her minister for
<location>Northern Ireland</location>, would make a statement soon about the
``organizational implications'' of the affair, the British
spokesman said.
   This was interpreted as a suggestion that <location>Britain</location> is considering
changes in the <organization>Royal Ulster Constablulary</organization>, which draws most of its
personnel from the Protestant majority.
   <person>King</person> has said disciplinary action could be taken against
officers involved in the affair.
   <person>Haughey</person> and Mrs. <person>Thatcher</person> met during an emergency economic
summit of the 12-nation <organization>European Economic Community</organization>.

   <person>Doc Whitehead</person> is a yapping yuppie, a 14-month-old
lakeland terrier whose paw print carries purchasing power.
   His owners, <person>Kenneth and Susan Whitehead</person>, gave him his own bank
account, and the distinctive paw-print signature has paid for a
parking ticket and a custom-made dog tag.
   <person>Doc</person> got his picture in the <organization>London Standard</organization> newspaper on <date>Friday</date>,
along with a photo of one of his checks.
   The paper said <person>Garrard</person>, the crown jewelers in <location>London</location>, accepted
<person>Doc</person>'s 5.75-pound (<money>$10</money>) check in payment for the dog tag.
   ``Normally we would not accept a check from a new client who is
a minor,'' the jeweler was quoted as telling the Whiteheads.
``However ... we are prepared to accept your personal guarantee of
<person>Doc</person>'s creditworthiness.''
   Mrs. <person>Whitehead</person> was quoted as saying that <person>Doc</person> got account at the
<location>Westminster Bank</location> branch in <location>Southall</location>, west <location>London</location>, ``so he could buy
his own toys,'' but he had to pay a parking ticket while out
shopping.
   ``<person>Doc</person> was responsible for us parking where we did, so when we
got a ticket, he paid the penalty,'' she was quoted as saying.
``The check was initially sent back with a note saying there was no
signature, but when I pointed out that the paw print was the
signature, there was no problem.''

<TEXT>
   Rep. <person>Jack Kemp</person> on <date>Friday</date> accused <person>Pat
Robertson</person>'s rival <organization>GOP</organization> presidential campaign of ``deliberate
distortions,'' and won a standing ovation from conservatives when
he lectured the former television evangelist on the need to obey
the Ten Commandments.
   ``I can't insist that all candidates abide by <person>Ronald Reagan</person>'s
11th commandment'' not to speak ill of another Republican, <person>Kemp</person>
said in an address to the <organization>Conservative Political Action Committee</organization>.
   ``But all of us should abide by the <location>Ninth Commandment</location>: <person>Thou
shalt</person> not bear false witness,'' he said to prolonged cheers.
   <person>Robertson</person> was scheduled to address the group immediately after
<person>Kemp</person>, but bad weather grounded his airplane in <location>New Hampshire</location> and
prevented his appearance.
   But his campaign issued a statement calling the congressman's
charges ``totally unfounded.'' <person>Connie Snapp</person>, an aide, said,
``Contrary to the charges, we have investigated and found that no
<organization>Robertson</organization> staff member was involved in the distribution of the
material in question.''
   In <location>Merrimack</location>, <location>N.H.</location>, <person>Robertson</person> said: ``We didn't put out any of
this stuff he's talking about. ... It's ridiculous what he's
talking about.''
   Meantime, <person>Robertson</person> and Sen. <person>Bob Dole</person> of <location>Kansas</location>, staying at the
same hotel, met for 30 minutes <date>Friday</date> night. Asked whether they
were striking a deal, <person>Dole</person> said: ``We just had a nice, pleasant
chat and a cup of coffee. He feels good about his chances. I feel
good about mine.''
   When asked if he would want to inherit <person>Robertson</person>'s supporters if
<person>Robertson</person> is defeated, <person>Dole</person> responded: ``I said we ought to put out
the melcome mat. These are good people. They're looking for a party
to join in many cases.''
   <person>Kemp</person>'s demand that <person>Robertson</person> repudiate a television commercial
being aired by his campaign as well as fliers distributed in early
primary and <location>caucus</location> states reflected the stakes involved in the
early stages of the <organization>GOP</organization> presidential campaign. <person>Kemp</person>'s bid to emerge
as a clear conservative alternative to Vice President <person>George Bush</person>
and <person>Dole</person> has been damaged by <person>Robertson</person>'s surprising showing in the
<location>Iowa</location> caucuses and in other states, making next <date>Tuesday</date>'s <location>New
Hampshire</location> primary a critical test.
   Thus, while <person>Kemp</person> said at a news conference that the <organization>Republicans</organization>
would be taking a ``step backward'' if they nominated either the
vice president or the <location>Kansas</location> senator, he saved his sharpest words
for <person>Robertson</person>.
   <person>Kemp</person> avoided leveling an accusation of dirty tricks personally
against <person>Robertson</person>, but said the former minister's campaign was
guilty of ``deliberate distortions.''
   ``I would like him to call off the flier and the ad,'' he said
following his speech. ``I would expect a response from <person>Pat</person>.''
   <person>Kemp</person>'s anger was generated by printed material saying he was
soft on pornography and suggesting that a member of his family had
had an abortion. ``It's a lie,'' <person>Mary Brunette</person>, a <person>Kemp</person> aide, said
of the abortion suggestion. ``There is absolutely no truth in it
whatsoever.''
   Distributed to fundamentalist Christian voters in <location>Iowa</location>, <location>New
Hampshire</location> and <location>Minnesota</location>, the material purports to reproduce ratings
of the Republican candidates by the <organization>Biblical Scoreboard</organization>, which is
published by <organization>Biblical News Service</organization>.
   <person>Jack Waldron</person>, editor of the news service, said the material was
altered and he described it as ``a malicious, nasty, underhanded
attempt to smear men who are running for president and an obvious
affront and attack on <organization>Biblical News Service</organization>.''
   The <location>New York</location> congressman also complained about a <organization>Robertson</organization>
television commercial that cited a study by <organization>Washington Econometrics
Forecasting Services</organization> saying that <person>Robertson</person> had the best economic
proposal of all the contenders and <person>Kemp</person> had one that would bring on
a depression.
   The commercial cites a <organization>Wall Street Journal</organization> story on the
forecast, but <person>Kemp</person> said the newspaper's coverage amounted to
ridicule since it placed the report ``in a humor section.''
   In addition, the <organization>Journal</organization> printed an editorial on <date>Feb. 5</date>
denouncing the use of its story in the television commercial.
   <person>Kemp</person>, in his formal remarks, said he had welcomed <person>Robertson</person>'s
followers into the ranks of the <organization>Republican Party</organization>.
   ``But the contribution ceases to be positive, the cause and
values that we represent are tarnished when such deliberate
distortions are permitted to persist,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas exploded dynamite under a
troop truck on a mountain highway <date>Friday</date>, killing 10 soldiers and
wounding 14, officials said.
   President <person>Alan Garcia</person> confirmed the attack by guerrillas
believed to belong to the <person>Mao</person>-inspired <organization>Shining Path</organization> organization,
which has been fighting for eight years to topple the government
and establish a Marxist state.
   An <organization>army</organization> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, later said
two of those killed were officers and several of the wounded were
badly hurt.
   In violence elsewhere <date>Friday</date>, a Marxist university professor
considered ideologically aligned to <organization>Shining Path</organization> was shot and
killed in <location>Ayacucho</location>, police said.
   <person>Garcia</person> told reporters in <location>Lima</location> the guerrillas set off dynamite
near the highland state capital of <location>Huanuco</location> as the troop truck
passed.
   ``The explosion nearly totally destroyed the vehicle,'' said
<person>Marino</person> <location>Mesa</location>, a correspondent for <organization>Radio Programas</organization>, <location>Peru</location>'s leading
news station, in a live broadcast from <location>Huanuco</location>.
   <organization>Mesa</organization> said the attack occurred 15 miles outside of <person>Huanuco</person>, which
lies 185 miles east of <location>Lima</location>.
   The soldiers were en route to repair a bridge destroyed during
torrential rains on the eastern slopes of the <organization>Andes</organization>.
   Five hooded assailants killed Professor <person>Rafael Alarcon</person>, 47,
after locking two of his children, aged 13 and 15, in another
bedroom, police said.
   At the time of the pre-dawn attack, <person>Alarcon</person>'s wife and four
other children were in <location>Lima</location>, 230 miles northwest of <location>Ayacucho</location>.
   <person>Alarcon</person> was a philosophy professor at the <organization>University of Huamanga</organization>
in <location>Ayacucho</location>, where he was known as a Marxist who reflected the
views of the <organization>Shining Path</organization>, police said.
   The assailants escaped. Police refused to speculate about their
identity and said an investigation was under way.
   The attack follows an upsurge of violence this week by rebels,
who shot and killed four policemen and the wife of one of the
officers, and five state telephone workers.
   The government says more than 10,000 people have died in the
<organization>Shining Path</organization> insurgency. Human rights groups say hundreds of the
dead were non-combatants caught in the crossfire between rebels and
government forces.

   A state official is being asked to help serve the
elusive <person>Walker Railey</person>, a former <location>Dallas</location> minister, with a wrongful
death suit that accuses him of trying to choke his wife to death.
   <person>Railey</person>'s mother-in-law, <person>Billie Jo Nicolai</person> filed an amended suit
<date>Thursday</date> asking the secretary of state to assist in notifying
<person>Railey</person> of the suit.
   <person>Margaret ``Peggy'' Railey</person>, 39, has been in a coma since she was
choked in the garage of the <organization>Railey</organization>'s home last year. Police say
they have not identified her attacker, but <person>Railey</person>'s attorney has
said his client is a suspect.
   <person>Railey</person>, former senior pastor at <location>Dallas</location>' First <organization>United Methodist
Church</organization>, is accused in the suit of trying to kill his wife by
strangling her with a cord. The suit asks for an unspecified amount
of money, medical care and damages.
   <person>Railey</person> moved to <location>San Francisco</location> late last year.
   ``We're still attempting to serve him (with notice of the suit)
personally, but we haven't been able to find him,'' said <person>A.W.
Arnold II</person>, Mrs. <person>Nicolai</person>'s attorney.
   <organization>Arnold</organization> said he is making use of a <location>Texas</location> law that allows him to
appoint the secretary of state as the agent for serving the suit.
   The secretary of state's office is required by the ``Long Arm''
statute to serve <person>Railey</person> with the suit by certified or registered
mail, said <person>Lorna Wassdorf</person>, head of statutory filing for the office.
   ``We don't determine if the service is valid,'' Ms. <person>Wassdorf</person>
said <date>Friday</date>.

   Three former police officers who pleaded guilty to
federal corruption, racketeering and cocaine trafficking charges
were each sentenced <date>Friday</date> to 30 years in prison and <money>$350,000</money> in
fines.
   <person>Armando Estrada</person>, 28, <person>Roman Rodriguez</person>, 31, and <person>Arturo De La Vega</person>,
28, were among the original seven <location>Miami</location> police defendants whose
first trial ended in a hung jury last year.
   In all, more than 70 of the department's 1,033 officers have
been arrested, fired or suspended since the investigation of
corruption began three years ago.
   <location>U.S.</location> District Judge <person>Kenneth L. Ryskamp</person> told the three during the
sentencing hearing that they shamed their entire profession during
the sentencing hearing.
   ``When I was a boy I thought a police officer must be the
highest calling ... but young people today have the perception of a
police officer as one who is corrupt,'' he said.
   <location>Miami</location> Police Chief <person>Clarence Dickson</person>, however, said the officers
arrested do not reflect on the integrity of his department. ``The
majority of the men and women on the streets are honest, upstanding
cops.''
   A fourth defendant, <person>Ricardo Aleman</person>, who was convicted on
narcotics and tax counts last year, was given a delay in sentencing
until <date>Feb. 26</date>.

<TEXT>
   Three <organization>Calvin College</organization> science
professors who taught evolution instead of the biblical version of
creation were sharply criticized in a report released <date>Friday</date> by
trustees of the private college.
   But the report, which followed a yearlong investigation by a
study committee, called for no sanctions against the professors and
concluded that their teachings fell within guidelines set by the
<organization>Christian Reformed Church</organization> for interpretation of the Bible.
   The report was ``very critical in a studied, careful, pastoral
way'' of the professors' writings and teachings, said the Rev.
<person>Charles De Ridder</person>, chairman of the board.
   It was supportive of the professors' concern for exploring
theories other than creationism, but <person>De Ridder</person> said the panel
``reminds the professors of the limitations that the guidelines
place upon the interpretation of the Bible.''
   The board said those guidelines allow the teachings of such
theories as evolution, but that they ``ought to be evaluated in
terms of the Christian faith,'' said <person>Gordon Van Harn</person>, provost of
the college.
   The study committee was formed in response to dozens of critical
letters about the professors from students, faculty, church members
and others, <person>De Ridder</person> said.
   The professors, <person>Clarence Menninga</person> and <person>Davis Young</person> of the geology
department and <person>Howard Van Till</person> of the physics department, who have
a combined 52 years at <person>Calvin</person>, did not attend the board's news
conference.
   However, <person>Van Till</person> said in a statement that he respected the
board for ``recognizing the need for academic freedom'' and that
the report contains both ``criticism and praise and speaks of both
caution and encouragement.''
   The committee ``urges me to refine my interpretative methods in
such a way that neither the `event character' nor the revelational
meaning of biblical history will be called into question,'' he said.
   The professors describe themselves as loyal, longtime members of
the 300,000-member, <location>Grand Rapids</location>-based <organization>Christian Reformed Church</organization>,
which owns <person>Calvin</person>.

quest for the presidency <date>Friday</date>, endorsing <location>Kansas</location> Sen. <person>Bob Dole</person> and
attacking Vice President <person>George Bush</person> as no more than a spectator in
<person>Reagan</person> administration councils.
   Asked his opinion of <person>Bush</person>'s involvement in important
decision-making, the former secretary of state said <person>Bush</person> had merely
``been there, period.''
   More than 200 reporters and at least 30 television cameras were
in the room for <person>Haig</person>'s announcement, by far the most coverage he
received at any time in his year-long campaign. He withdrew from
the race for the Republican presidential nomination at a news
conference on a day when a snowstorm played havoc with the
schedules of the remaining candidates.
   He opened by saying his assessment of the race had made it clear
that ``<person>Al Haig</person> will not be the <date>1988</date> Republican nominee.''
   <person>Haig</person> received less than <percent>1 percent</percent> of the vote in the <location>Iowa

``means a great deal to me personally'' and that the former <organization>NATO</organization>
commander had told him he wanted no role in a <person>Dole</person> administration.
   While free with his praise of <person>Dole</person>, <person>Haig</person> seemed to relish even
more his attacks on <person>Bush</person>.
   ``What have you got against <person>George Bush</person>?'' <person>Haig</person> was asked.
   ``Not a single thing in terms of <person>George Bush</person>,'' he replied.
``He's a friend, I've known him for 20 years.''
   But he went on to say that he had worked with both men for two
decades and ``from my point of view, <person>Bob Dole</person> is head and shoulders
above <person>George Bush</person> as a potential president.''
   ``Most important of all,'' he said, <organization>Dole</organization> exceeds <person>Bush</person> in ``the
demeanor, the internal strength, the ability to deal eyeball to
eyeball with those who do not share our values around the world.''
   <person>Bush</person> later phoned <organization>WKNE</organization> in <location>Keene</location> to boast that he won the
immediate endorsement of state Rep. <person>Edward Bennett</person> of <location>Bridgewater</location>,
one of <person>Haig</person>'s three state co-chairman.
   Then on <location>Manchester</location> television, <person>Bush</person> said <person>Bennett</person> ``thinks that
I'm head and shoulders above <person>Bob Dole</person>.''
   <person>Haig</person>'s greatest contribution to the <organization>Dole</organization> campaign may well have
come earlier, during televised debates when he pressed <person>Bush</person> on his
role in the <organization>Iran-Contra</organization> affair and asked him if he had been ``in
the cockpit or ... on an economy ride in the back of the plane'' as
vice president.
   When asked <date>Friday</date> about reports of <person>Bush</person> involvement with
Panamanian strongman Gen. <person>Manuel Antonio Noriega</person>, <person>Haig</person> said, ``I do
think there's been less than forthright discussion of this issue by
the vice president.''
   <person>Haig</person> withdrew four days before the <location>New Hampshire</location> primary, and
when asked about the timing he replied in a sentence typical of
what had become known during his public career as Haigspeak:
   ``It takes a bit of arrogance to be so ego-involved in a
campaign such as this that you want to take the few percentage
points that could be critical to another candidate to the political
graveyard.
   ``I'm not that way. I want to make a difference.''
   As a candidate, the 63-year-old retired general who had
announced last year he was ``throwing my helmet into the ring'' was
often openly critical of <person>Reagan</person> administration domestic and foreign
policies.
   Speaking with the authority of having been <person>Reagan</person>'s first
secretary of state, <person>Haig</person> has criticized the president's approach in
the <location>Persian Gulf</location> and also has opposed the <organization>INF</organization> treaty to eliminate
medium-range missiles from <location>Europe</location>.
   On domestic issues, he has said the record federal budget
deficits of the Reagan years stemmed, in part, from the policies
pursued by the administration, making him the only candidate other
than <person>Dole</person> to lay some of the blame somewhere other than on <organization>Congress</organization>.
   In campaign appearances <person>Haig</person> was fond of saying he had served
under seven presidents and recalling his strong role as chief of
staff in the <organization>White House</organization> during the final months of <person>Richard M.
Nixon</person>'s presidency.
   At a Republican dinner in <location>Nashua</location> <date>Wednesday</date> night he quipped,
``I'm the only one (of the <organization>GOP</organization> candidates) who's been president
before and I liked it.''

<HEAD>Ethiopia Calls Report Of Resettlement Killings `Unfounded'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government accused foreign
media <date>Friday</date> of a disinformation campaign and said a report that
Ethiopian troops killed at least 20 civilians at a drought relief
camp was ``unfounded.''
   ``Fanatics of one calling or another have in recent months tried
to disrupt the relief distribution efforts and their accomplices
continue to fabricate such unfounded allegations,'' said the <organization>Relief
and Rehabilitation Commission</organization>, the government agency responsible
for drought relief.
   ``This latest unfounded report is just another instance,'' the
commission said in a statement.
   Foreign relief sources in <location>Ethiopia</location> said <date>Thursday</date> that Ethiopian
troops opened fire on thousands of drought victims when civilians
resisted forced resettlement. Twenty people were killed and many
others wounded, the sources said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The sources said the shootings occurred <date>Monday</date> at the northern
town of <organization>Korem</organization> in <location>Tigray Province</location>, 525 miles north of the capital,
<location>Addis Ababa</location>.
   ``No one in his right mind can imagine that any responsible
person can commit such an atrocity against drought victims,'' the
commission said.
   The commission said it had stated repeatedly that the
resettlement program was voluntary.
   <person>Tigray</person> and its northern neighbor, <location>Eritrea</location>, are the hardest hit
by a drought that threatens more than 5 million Ethiopians with
starvation. Drought in the northern regions has been exacerbated by
a civil war in <location>Eritrea</location>.
   <location>Ethiopia</location>'s Marxist government began the resettlement program in
<date>November 1984</date> with a goal of moving 1.5 million people from the
overpopulated, drought-ravaged north to unused, fertile land in the
south and west.
   At least 600,000 people were resettled before the government
halted the program in <date>February 1986</date> amid charges from the West that
people were being forced to move, sometimes at gunpoint. Critics
said the government's aim is to depopulate the north, which is home
to two rebel movements.
   <location>Ethiopia</location> resumed resettlement <date>Nov. 25</date>, promising the program
would be voluntary and humane.

   Network polls released <date>Friday</date> showed Vice
President <person>George Bush</person> and Sen. <person>Bob Dole</person> neck-in-neck for <location>New

and the other giving <person>Bush</person> the edge.

<person>Bush</person> with <percent>32 percent</percent> to <person>Dole</person>'s <percent>26 percent</percent>. That was an increase
over the vice president's <percent>33 percent</percent> to <percent>29 percent</percent> edge in polling
<date>Tuesday</date>, the network said.
   But <organization>CBS News</organization> reported that its latest poll, taken <date>Wednesday</date> and

The network said polling <date>Tuesday</date> and <date>Wednesday</date> had <person>Bush</person> on top, <percent>35
percent</percent> to <percent>27 percent</percent>.
   In both polls, <location>Massachusetts</location> Gov. <person>Michael Dukakis</person> maintained a

   The <organization>CBS</organization> poll was based on interviews with 499 <organization>Republicans</organization> and

<HEAD>Demonstrators Protest Nuclear Reactor Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 500 people demonstrated outside the
headquarters of an electric power company in southwestern <location>Japan</location>
<date>Friday</date> protesting a test at a nuclear power reactor.
   Some of the demonstrators had stayed overnight at the site after
attending a rally <date>Thursday</date> that police said drew 1,500 people.
   The protesters at the headquarters in <location>Takamatsu</location> of the <organization>Shikoku
Elecric Power Co.</organization> opposed an output test at the company's nuclear
reactor at <organization>Ikata</organization> that was conducted <date>Friday</date>.
   Takamatsu is 340 miles southwest of <location>Tokyo</location> and <person>Ikata</person> is 115 miles
southwest of <location>Takamatsu</location>.
   <person>Sueaki Maekawa</person>, a member of a local anti-nuclear group, said,
``The protest action was initiated by ordinary people, such as
housewives, who have no affiliation with big organizations. It is
really encouraging.''
   Police spokesman <person>Yasunori Aya</person> said about 300 police officers
were sent to the demonstration <date>Friday</date> to keep order. The protesters
were ``noisy but not violent'' and there were no arrests, he said.
   A <location>Shikoku</location> company official said that in the test, the reactor's
output was reduced by <percent>50 percent</percent> over a period of three hours. The
official, speaking with the condition he not be identified, said
the test was made to collect data on rapid reactor output shifts
dealing with the fluctuating demand for power.
   Protesters said the test was similar to one conducted at the
<location>Chernobyl</location> nuclear power complex in the <location>Soviet Union</location> on <date>April 26,
1986</date> that resulted in a fire and the world's worst nuclear
accident. The Soviets said at least 31 people perished from the
fire or radiation.
   The company official said the tests were different. He said the
Soviets tried to stop the turbine completely and the Japanese test
only involved a <percent>50 percent</percent> cutback.
   He said the Soviets also disconnected safety devices at the
<location>Chernobyl</location> plant, while the devices at the Ikata reactor remained in
operation.
   The <organization>Kyodo News Service</organization> quoted <person>Soichiro Ito</person>, director-general of
<organization>Science and Technology Agency</organization>, as saying there was was no cause for
concern about the safety of the test.

<HEAD>Drivers and Mechanics Approve Settlement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bus drivers and mechanics overwhelmingly
approved a contract proposal <date>Friday</date> night to end an 11-day strike
that had left 90,000 daily riders without public transportation.
   The board that runs the <location>Queen City Metro</location> transit system also
approved the tentative agreement and hoped to restore bus service
by <date>Sunday</date> morning.
   ``Strikes are tough. ... I hope we can mend those fences,'' said
<person>Robert Baker</person>, president of the striking <organization>Local 627 of the
Amalgamated Transit Union</organization>.
   Negotiators concluded an all-night bargaining session <date>Friday</date>
morning by announcing they had reached a compromise agreement. The
three-year proposal gives the union greater job security and wage
increases of about <percent>5 percent</percent> the first year and <percent>4 percent</percent> each of
the two final years, <person>Baker</person> said.
   <person>Baker</person> said union leadership urged passage of the settlement,
which was approved at a union meeting by a 465-40 margin.
   The strike against the <location>Queen City Metro</location> transit agency began
<date>Feb. 2</date> over wages and the company's proposal to use part-time
employees to supplement regular workers during peak transit hours.
The union, which represents about 750 bus drivers, mechanics and
clerks, strongly objected to part-time employees in the belief they
pose a threat to the jobs of full-time employees.
   A top-scale bus driver made <money>$12.17</money> an hour, under the old
contract. <location>Queen City Metro</location> says drivers were making about <money>$30,000</money> a
year when routine overtime was figured in.

<HEAD>Appeal By Intellectuals Is Criticized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of 30 prominent intellectuals
appealed to communist authorities to respect the right of free
association, but the state-run <organization>PAP</organization> news agency called their
petition unnecessary.
   In a commentary on its English-language service released late
<date>Thursday</date>, <organization>PAP</organization> said the appeal's ``postulates seem to be somewhat
belated, like trying to pry open doors which are already open.''
   It said the signers ``do not take notice of ... very important
changes which have occurred and continue to occur in <location>Poland</location>'s
socio-political life,'' including a relaxation of censorship to
allow public debates on ``practically all internal problems.''
   In <date>December</date>, the <organization>Polish United Workers</organization> (<organization>Communist) Party</organization>
approved a package of political reforms that includes a pledge to
ease curbs on forming independent associations.
   However, a new law on associations has not been passed yet, and
authorities have blocked efforts to form some independent groups
such as the <organization>Economic Society</organization>, a lobbying group favoring private
enterprise.
   The intellectuals' petition was submitted to <organization>Parliament</organization> on <date>Feb.
1</date> and was made public this week.
   The appeal said it is ``impossible to start overcoming
(<location>Poland</location>'s) crisis without real, and not only declarative, respect
for the citizens' right to free association.'' It said every
citizen should have the right to demand changes in the law without
being punished for doing so.
   The signers included 11 full members of the prestigious <organization>Polish
Academy of Science</organization>; <location>Warsaw</location> University rector <person>Grzegorz Bialkowski</person>;
former <organization>Solidarity</organization> economic adviser <person>Ryszard Bugaj</person>; and the <organization>Economic
Society</organization>'s chairman, <person>Aleksander Paszynski</person>.
