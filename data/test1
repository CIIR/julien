<HEAD>Reports Former Saigon Officials Released from Re-education Camp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 150 former officers of the
overthrown South Vietnamese government have been released from a
re-education camp after 13 years of detention, the official <organization>Vietnam
News Agency</organization> reported <date>Saturday</date>.
   The report from <location>Hanoi</location>, monitored in <location>Bangkok</location>, did not give
specific figures, but said those freed <date>Friday</date> included an
ex-<organization>Cabinet</organization> minister, a deputy minister, 10 generals, 115
field-grade officers and 25 chaplains.
   It quoted Col. <person>Luu Van Ham</person>, director of the <organization>Nam Ha</organization> camp south of
<location>Hanoi</location>, as saying all 700 former South Vietnamese officials who had
been held at the camp now have been released.
   They were among 1,014 South Vietnamese who were to be released
from re-education camps under an amnesty announced by the Communist
government to mark <person>Tet</person>, the lunar new year that begins <date>Feb. 17</date>.
   The <organization>Vietnam News Agency</organization> report said many foreign journalists and
a delegation from the <location>Australia</location>-<organization>Vietnam Friendship Association</organization>
attended the <organization>Nam Ha</organization> release ceremony.
   It said Lt. Gen. <person>Nguyen Vinh Nghi</person>, former commander of South
<location>Vietnam</location>'s Third <organization>Army Corps</organization>, and Col. <person>Tran Duc Minh</person>, former director
of the <organization>Army Infantry Officers School</organization>, expressed ``gratitude to the
government for its humane treatment in spite of the fact that most
of them (detainees) had committed heinous crimes against the
country and people.''
   The prisoners had been held without formal charges or trial
since <location>North Vietnam</location> defeated the <location>U.S.</location>-backed South Vietnamese
government in <date>April 1975</date>, ending the Vietnam War.
   Communist authorities had called the prisoners war criminals and
said they had to learn how to become citizens of the new society.
   Small numbers had been released occasionally without publicity
but the government announced last year that 480 political prisoners
would be freed to mark <date>National Day</date> on <date>Sept. 2</date>.
   On <date>Thursday</date>, Vice Minister of Information <person>Phan Quang</person> said 1,014
would be released under the Tet amnesty.
   He reported a total of 150 prisoners would remain in the camps,
which he said once held 100,000.
   ``Depending on their repentance, they will gradually be released
within a short period of time,'' <person>Quang</person> said.
   He said many of the former inmates would return to their
families in <location>Ho Chi Minh City</location>, formerly the South Vietnamese capital
of <location>Saigon</location>.
   The amnesties apparently are part of efforts by <organization>Communist Party</organization>
chief <person>Nguyen Van Linh</person> to heal internal divisions and improve
<location>Vietnam</location>'s image abroad.

<HEAD>Iowa Caucus Results Shake Up New Hampshire Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ripples from the <location>Iowa precinct</location> caucuses are
spreading to <location>New Hampshire</location>, boosting winners and damaging losers in
the final days before the nation's first primary, polls indicate.
   Vice President <person>George Bush</person>, who was slipping in <location>New Hampshire</location>
even before his third-place <location>Iowa</location> finish, lost more ground in polls
this week. Democratic third-place finisher <person>Michael Dukakis</person> also
lost support, but not as much.
   <location>Iowa</location>, meanwhile, has boosted the candidacies of Rep. <person>Richard
Gephardt</person> of <location>Missouri</location> and Sen. <person>Bob Dole</person> of <location>Kansas</location>, the Democratic
and Republican winners, and has aided <person>Pat Robertson</person>, <location>Iowa</location>'s
surprise second-place Republican finisher, the polls indicate.
   As recently as two weeks ago, <person>Bush</person> commanded the <organization>New Hampshire
GOP</organization> field. A <organization>CBS News-New York Times</organization> poll in the last week of
<date>January</date> had him <percent>22 percentage points</percent> over <person>Dole</person>, the same place he'd
held in polls since <date>November</date> and earlier.
   But a crack appeared last week, when an <organization>ABC News</organization>-<organization>Washington Post</organization>
poll found <person>Bush</person>'s lead sharply diminished, to <percent>7 percentage points</percent>.
After <location>Iowa</location>'s vote <date>Monday</date>, <organization>ABC</organization> found the spread down to <percent>4 percentage
points</percent>: <person>Bush</person>, 33, <person>Dole</person>, 29.
   In a poll with an error margin of <percent>6 percentage points</percent>, that
amounted to a dead heat. Another survey, done for <organization>The Boston Globe</organization>
this week by pollster <person>Gary Orren</person>, had essentially he same result:
<person>Bush</person> 29, <person>Dole</person> 27. <organization>CBS</organization> on <date>Thursday</date> had it as <person>Bush</person> 35, <person>Dole</person> 27 _
still a big drop for the vice president.
   ``<person>Dole</person> got a very big kick out of <location>Iowa</location>; more than that, there is
some reluctance in the support for <person>Bush</person>,'' <person>Orren</person> said <date>Thursday</date>.
``He's shown vulnerability, and that's sort of arousing doubts
people have about him.''
   ``The unanswered question is how far <person>Bush</person> will fall,'' <person>Richard
Morin</person>, polling director for <organization>The Washington Post</organization>. ``The expectation
is that he will continue to drop. That's been the clear direction.''
   If voters were leaving <person>Bush</person> before <location>Iowa</location>, it was not clear where
they were going, <person>Morin</person> said. This week the chief gainers turned out
to be <person>Dole</person> and <person>Robertson</person>, whose support was up to <percent>10 percent</percent> in the
<organization>ABC</organization> and <organization>CBS</organization> polls, from <percent>6 percent</percent> last week and <percent>4 percent</percent> two weeks
ago.
   Rep. <person>Jack Kemp</person> of <location>New York</location> held steady at <percent>13 percent</percent> in the <organization>ABC</organization>
poll, and fell from <percent>16 percent</percent> to <percent>12 percent</percent> in the <organization>CBS</organization> poll.
Analysts said he now may be challenged by <person>Robertson</person> for third place
in <location>New Hampshire</location>.
   ``<person>Kemp</person> was gaining last week. <location>Iowa</location> ended that,'' said <person>Morin</person>.
   <location>Iowa</location>'s effect on the Democratic race probably is in the battle
for second place, not first, pollsters said. <location>Massachusetts</location> Gov.
<person>Dukakis</person>, despite finishing third in <location>Iowa</location>, maintained a strong lead
in <location>New Hampshire</location> _ but he no longer had the huge <percent>49 percent</percent> support
indicated in an <organization>NBC-Wall Street Journal</organization> poll in <date>November</date>.
   Three polls indicated a drop in support for <person>Dukakis</person>, to <percent>36
percent</percent> in the <organization>ABC-Post</organization> survey this week from <percent>41 percent</percent> last week;
to <percent>35 percent</percent> in the <organization>Globe</organization>'s survey, from <percent>38 percent</percent> last week; and
to <percent>38 percent</percent> in the <organization>CBS</organization> poll, from <percent>40 percent</percent> in late <date>January</date>.
   A fourth new poll, however _ done for <organization>WBZ-TV</organization> in <location>Boston</location>, <organization>WRC-TV</organization>
in <location>Washington</location> and the <organization>Boston Herald</organization> _ said <person>Dukakis</person>' support had
risen from <percent>36 percent</percent> at the end of <date>January</date> to <percent>44 percent</percent> this week.
   ``It's a big lead for <person>Dukakis</person> no matter whose poll you're
looking at _ and a strong one, too,'' said <person>Jeff Alderman</person>, chief of
polling for <organization>ABC News</organization>. He said <percent>58 percent</percent> of <person>Dukakis</person>' backers told
<organization>ABC</organization> they supported him strongly.
   The win in <location>Iowa</location> transformed <person>Gephardt</person>, who had single-digit
support in <location>New Hampshire</location> as recently as last month. The <organization>CBS</organization> poll
had him at <percent>19 percent</percent>, up from <percent>7 percent</percent> in late <date>January</date>; <organization>ABC</organization>'s
poll put him this week at <percent>22 percent</percent>, up from <percent>13 percent</percent> last week.
The <organization>Globe</organization> had him at <percent>18 percent</percent>, up from 8, and the <organization>WBZ</organization> poll had
him at 17, up from 8 last month.
   Poll results were more mixed on <person>Gephardt</person>'s chief rival, Sen.
<person>Paul Simon</person> of <location>Illinois</location>, the second-place finisher in <location>Iowa</location>. He moved
to <percent>18 percent</percent> from <percent>13 percent</percent> in <organization>ABC</organization>'s poll, to 13 from 11 in <organization>WBZ</organization>'s
and fell in the <organization>Globe</organization>'s, to 12 from 17. He held about even in the
<organization>CBS</organization> poll, at <percent>15 percent</percent> this week.
   Movement is taking place at the bottom as well as the top of the
pack. Former Sen. <person>Gary Hart</person> of <location>Colorado</location>, who had <percent>11 percent</percent> in the
<organization>WBZ</organization> and <organization>Globe</organization> polls last week, fell to single-digit support after
winning just <percent>1 percent</percent> in <location>Iowa</location>. <person>Hart</person> and former <location>Arizona</location> Gov. <person>Bruce
Babbitt</person>, also a poor finisher in <location>Iowa</location>, went from <percent>7 percent</percent> in <organization>ABC</organization>'s
<organization>New Hampshire</organization> poll last week to <percent>4 percent</percent> this week.

<HEAD>Parents Of Slain Man Drop Lawsuit Against Mexican Drug Lord</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parents of a student slain when he
apparently stumbled onto a reputed Mexican drug lord's party have
dropped a <money>$2 billion</money> lawsuit against the man, saying a trial would
rekindle painful memories.
   <person>Alberto Radelat</person>, a dental student, and journalist <person>John Walker</person>
were tortured and killed in <date>February 1985</date> in <location>Guadalajara</location>, <location>Mexico</location>,
and authorities there said they believed the men were executed
because they were mistaken for drug agents.
   On <date>Jan. 29</date>, Dr. <person>Felipe Radelat</person> and his wife, <person>Ana</person>, filed a wrong
death action against reputed drug lord <person>Rafael Caro Quintero</person>, whom
authorities have blamed for the deaths.
   The younger <person>Radelat</person> and <person>Walker</person> had apparently entered a
restaurant where <person>Quintero</person> was holding an after-hours party.
   A witness told the <organization>Radelats</organization> that their son and <person>Walker</person> were
stabbed with icepicks and switchblades before they were dumped in a
crude grave outside <location>Guadalajara</location>, where their bodies were found in
<date>June 1985</date>.
   On <date>Thursday</date>, <person>Radelat</person> said he dropped the suit a week after
filing it because it would revive memories the family had tried to
put behind them.
   ``My wife had settled down, and this brought it all up again,''
he said. ``We don't want any more bad memories. It was a sad
experience. I hope no one ever has to go through it.''
   <person>Quintero</person> was among nine people indicted <date>Jan. 6</date> by federal
officials in <location>Los Angeles</location> in connection with the deaths of <organization>Drug
Enforcement Administration</organization> agent <person>Enrique Camarena</person> and his pilot,
who were killed about a week after <person>Radelat</person> and <person>Walker</person> were slain.
   Quintero is in a Mexican jail charged with all four deaths; <location>U.S.</location>
authorities indicted him and the others in <location>Camarena</location>'s death in an
effort to bring them to justice if Mexican authorities don't
prosecute them.
   <person>Radelat</person> said he filed the lawsuit because the <location>U.S.</location> government
had not indicted <person>Quintero</person> in the other deaths.
   ``We were disappointed they (<location>U.S.</location> officials) indicted <person>Quintero</person>
just for the drug agent, not the other Americans,'' <person>Radelat</person> said.
``We wanted to do this (suit) not so much for the money but just to
do justice for our son.''

   Price supports for peanuts grown under 1988
quotas will be <money>$615.27</money> per ton, an increase of <money>$7.80</money> from last
year, the <organization>Agriculture Department</organization> said <date>Friday</date>.
   Deputy Secretary <person>Peter C. Myers</person> said the increase was required
by a formula in the law which takes rising production costs into
consideration.
   The annual quota is set at a level equal to the estimated
quantity of peanuts that will be needed for domestic edible uses,
seed and related purposes.
   Production of non-quota peanuts, which can be grown for peanut
oil and meal, and for export, will be supported at <money>$149.75</money> per ton,
unchanged from last year, <person>Myers</person> said.
   In setting the support for non-quota peanuts, officials are
required to consider certain factors, including the demand for oil
and meal, the expected prices for other vegetable oils and meals,
and the foreign demand for peanuts.

<TEXT>
   The end was bitter, his helmet dented from the
combat of the campaign, and true to form, retired four-star Gen.
<person>Alexander M. Haig Jr.</person> reined in his dark horse quest for the
presidency in a pugnacious mood.
   <person>Haig</person> made clear that his new objective was not to seek the keys
to the <organization>White House</organization> for himself but to deny them to Vice President
<person>George Bush</person>.
   From the very beginning, when he announced, ``I'm throwing my
helmet into the ring,'' the 63-year-old former secretary of state
never rose above the low single digits in public opinion polls.
   He stopped campaigning in the <location>Iowa</location> caucuses in frustration that
his message and his personality had not taken hold.
   ``This is hangover day,'' <person>Haig</person> said, when the <location>Iowa</location> votes were
counted and he ended up with less than <percent>3 percent</percent> of the vote in the
<organization>GOP</organization> field.
   Throughout his campaign, <person>Haig</person> described himself as ``the darkest
of dark horses.''
   His political picture never brightened, perhaps because he
failed to find a way to do what he himself said he had to do to win.
   ``I've learned the secret of life ... It's in marketing,'' <person>Haig</person>
told a <location>Denver</location> audience early in the campaign.
   ``And that's what I'm trying to do today _ marketing.''
   After <location>Iowa</location>, <person>Haig</person> had trouble finding a silver lining.
   ``I'm in it to the bitter end and that bitter end may be the
inability to raise enough money to stay in it,'' he said.
   <person>Haig</person> has been supreme allied commander in <location>Europe</location>, and <organization>White
House</organization> chief of staff as well as secretary of state and presidential
contender.
   In all of those roles, he demonstrated a vivid _ sometimes
pungent _ grasp of the English language.
   When his hopes for <location>Iowa</location> were still high, <person>Haig</person> told audiences:
``I think it's important that a city slicker like <person>Al Haig</person>, who's
been abroad and lived in our nation's capital perhaps too long,
doesn't come out here and tell agricultural experts how to suck
eggs.''
   Complaining about the <person>Reagan</person> administration's supply-side
economic policies, he said they bore the mark of ``ideological
religiosity.''
   He himself described some of his more obscure references and
word combinations as ``Haigspeak.''
   <person>Haig</person> sensed a measure of public reluctance to put a former
four-star general in the <organization>White House</organization> and his first television
commercials were designed to counter that.
   One listed the names of the dozen generals who have served as
president, asserting that none of the nation's eight wars began in
their administrations.
   `<person>Ive</person> led troops in battle, seen the horror of war, I know the
imperative of peace,'' the former general said, asserting the need
to elect a president with ``strength, skill and understanding.''
   He said the idea of a nuclear-free world is ``bizarre,''
asserting that Soviet nuclear weapons can only be detered by other
nuclear weapons, not eliminated.
   When the stock market crashed last <date>October</date>, <person>Haig</person> said <person>Washington</person>
had sown the seeds of disaster.
   ``Overnight the famous bull market of the <date>eighties</date> was eaten
alive by the most infamous bear market in our financial history,''
he said, attributing the market's nose dive to ``a pervasive lack
of confidence in our government's ability to deal with budget and
trade deficits.''
   <person>Bush</person> was a preoccupation for much of the <person>Haig</person> campaign.
   <person>Haig</person> tried repeatedly to pin down the vice president on what
advice he gave to <person>Reagan</person> in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   ``Were you in the cockpit,'' <person>Haig</person> said in typically colorful
language, ``or were you on an economy ride in the back of the
plane?''

   A court ruled <date>Friday</date> that an egg
producer who kept his 2,000 hens in small cages was not guilty of
cruelty to animals, as alleged by animal rights activists.
   ``The verdict is a great relief. It would have been too much to
be found guilty of cruelty to my 2,000 hens,'' <person>Karl Wettre</person> was
quoted as saying by the <organization>national NTB</organization> news agency after his
acquittal.
   The <organization>National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals</organization>
claimed that by keeping hens in small cages, <person>Wettre</person> violated
national legislation to allow animals' natural development and
behavior.

stipulating that a hen should have at least 112 square inches of

   <organization>NSPCA</organization> chairman <person>Toralf Metveit</person> was quoted as saying: ``I'm
disappointed but not surprised.''
   The society was ordered pay <money>$15,600</money> in court costs.

<TEXT>
   Strategists for <person>Jack Kemp</person>'s presidential
campaign say <person>George Bush</person>'s poor showing in <location>Iowa</location>, coupled with
<person>Kemp</person>'s tough-talking ads against <person>Bob Dole</person>, could put <person>Kemp</person> in the
running for the Republican nomination.
   Before last <date>Monday</date>'s <location>Iowa</location> caucuses, <person>Kemp</person> had been on a roll in
<location>New Hampshire</location>, using an effective advertising campaign and the
endorsement of the influential <organization>Concord Monitor</organization> to help broaden
support.
   But even as his bid to become the conservative alternative to
<person>Dole</person> and <person>Bush</person> took shape, the <location>New York</location> congressman faced the
possibility of being swept out of the race by former television
evangelist <person>Pat Robertson</person>.
   Using his second-place finish in <location>Iowa</location> _ <person>Kemp</person> came in fourth _
<person>Robertson</person> was trying to move <person>Kemp</person> aside and take the mantle of true
conservative. A poll of <location>New Hampshire</location> voters by the <organization>Boston Globe</organization>
<date>Thursday</date> night indicated <person>Robertson</person> had drawn even with <person>Kemp</person> among
potential Republican voters in next <date>Tuesday</date>'s primary.
   <person>Charles Douglas</person>, <person>Kemp</person>'s <location>New Hampshire</location> campaign manager, says the
<location>Buffalo</location> congressman wants to finish second or third in a cluster
with <person>Bush</person> and <person>Dole</person>.
   ``We want to be in the 28-30-<percent>31 percent</percent> range with them,''
<person>Douglas</person> said.
   He conceded that <person>Kemp</person> cannot afford another fourth-place finish,
saying, ``We need to do well here so we can raise money and
continue on to the South. We need to have at least a close third
here.''
   <person>Kemp</person> spent most of the week in <location>New Hampshire</location> making his case at
coffee klatches, before high school students and in speeches to the
party faithful. He is hopeful that his energetic person-to-person
style and strong conservative message will make him the
conservative alternative.
   <person>John Buckley</person> is <person>Kemp</person>'s chief campaign strategist.
   ``What you saw tonight,'' <person>Buckley</person> said after <person>Kemp</person> spoke before
<date>800</date> <organization>Republicans</organization> in <location>Nashua</location> earlier this week,``was <person>Kemp</person> making an
appeal to the heart and soul of the Reagan vote in <location>New Hampshire</location>.
We consider that to be the largest single vote in the Republican
primary electorate.''
   <person>Buckley</person> said <person>Bush</person>'s third-place finish in <location>Iowa</location> presented <person>Kemp</person>
with a <location>New Hampshire</location> opportunity he never thought he would see.
   ``It was a lucky break that the guy who got severely wounded in
<location>Iowa</location> was <person>George Bush</person>, (someone) we never thought we could beat in
the <location>New Hampshire</location> primary.''
   <person>Kemp</person>'s strategy had focused on <organization>Dole</organization> because, as <person>Buckley</person> put it,
<person>Dole</person> is ``extraordinarily vulnerable in <location>New Hampshire</location> because of
his predilection for raising taxes, his four different positions on
oil import fees and his wanting to cut Social Security in a state
that has an elderly, Republican electorate.''
   ``We learned a lesson last month in <location>Iowa</location>,'' <person>Buckley</person> said. ``The
news media was interested in <person>Bush</person>-<person>Dole</person>, <person>Dole-Bush</person>, <person>Bush</person>-<person>Dole</person>,
almost as if they were the only two variables.
   ``The lesson was that by being very specific on issues in a
tough, hard-hitting way, we could pry the door open to get people
to take a look at <person>Kemp</person>.''
   <person>Robertson</person> is now running ads in <location>New Hampshire</location> saying he is the
best alternative to <person>Bush</person> and <person>Dole</person> and noting that he has already
beaten <person>Kemp</person>.
   But <person>Buckley</person> says <person>Robertson</person> can't repeat his showing in <location>Iowa</location>
because of an inherently negative message that won't be effective
in <location>New Hampshire</location>.
   ``For all the voters who may be more comfortable with the gloom
and doom and dour message of <person>Pat Robertson</person>, that we're going to
hell in a handbasket, there are many more who will respond to a
positive conservative message,'' <person>Buckley</person> said.
   ``I'm a conservative,'' <person>Kemp</person> told a living room full of
<organization>Republicans</organization> in <location>Milford</location>. ``But I'll tell you what, folks, some
things need money spent on them. We've got to shelter the homeless;
we've got to feed and clothe and take care of people who can't take
care of themselves ... and we've got to have a strong defense.''

<HEAD>90 Soldiers Arrested After Coup Attempt In Tribal Homeland</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 90 soldiers have been
arrested and face possible death sentences stemming from a coup
attempt in <location>Bophuthatswana</location>, leaders of the tribal homeland said
<date>Friday</date>.
   Rebel soldiers staged the takeover bid <date>Wednesday</date>, detaining
homeland President <person>Lucas Mangope</person> and several top <organization>Cabinet</organization> officials
for 15 hours before South African soldiers and police rushed to the
homeland, rescuing the leaders and restoring them to power.
   At least three soldiers and two civilians died in the uprising.
   <organization>Bophuthatswana's</organization> Minister of Justice <person>G. Godfrey Mothibe</person> told a
news conference that those arrested have been charged with high
treason and if convicted could be sentenced to death. He said the
accused were to appear in court <date>Monday</date>.
   All those arrested in the coup attempt have been described as
young troops, the most senior being a warrant officer.
   During the coup rebel soldiers installed as head of state <organization>Rocky
Malebane-Metsing</organization>, leader of the opposition <organization>Progressive Peoples
Party</organization>.
   <person>Malebane-Metsing</person> escaped capture and his whereabouts remained
unknown, officials said. Several unsubstantiated reports said he
fled to nearby <location>Botswana</location>.
   Warrant Officer <person>M.T.F. Phiri</person>, described by <person>Mangope</person> as one of the
coup leaders, was arrested <date>Friday</date> in <location>Mmabatho</location>, capital of the
nominally independent homeland, officials said.
   <person>Bophuthatswana</person>, which has a population of <money>1.7 million</money> spread
over seven separate land blocks, is one of 10 tribal homelands in
<location>South Africa</location>. About half of <location>South Africa</location>'s 26 million blacks live
in the homelands, none of which are recognized internationally.
   <person>Hennie Riekert</person>, the homeland's defense minister, said South
African troops were to remain in <location>Bophuthatswana</location> but will not become
a ``permanent presence.''
   <person>Bophuthatswana</person>'s Foreign Minister <person>Solomon Rathebe</person> defended <location>South
Africa</location>'s intervention.
   ``The fact that ... the South African government (was invited)
to assist in this drama is not anything new nor peculiar to
<person>Bophuthatswana</person>,'' <person>Rathebe</person> said. ``But why <location>South Africa</location>, one might
ask? Because she is the only country with whom <person>Bophuthatswana</person>
enjoys diplomatic relations and has formal agreements.''
   <person>Mangope</person> described the mutual defense treaty between the homeland
and <location>South Africa</location> as ``similar to the <organization>NATO</organization> agreement,'' referring to
the <location>Atlantic</location> military alliance. He did not elaborate.
   Asked about the causes of the coup, <person>Mangope</person> said, ``We granted
people freedom perhaps ... to the extent of planning a thing like
this.''
   The uprising began around <time>2 a.m.</time> <date>Wednesday</date> when rebel soldiers
took <person>Mangope</person> and his top ministers from their homes to the national
sports stadium.
   On <date>Wednesday</date> evening, South African soldiers and police stormed
the stadium, rescuing <person>Mangope</person> and his <organization>Cabinet</organization>.
   South African President <person>P.W. Botha</person> and three of his <organization>Cabinet</organization>
ministers flew to <location>Mmabatho</location> late <date>Wednesday</date> and met with <person>Mangope</person>, the
homeland's only president since it was declared independent in <date>1977</date>.
   The South African government has said, without producing
evidence, that the outlawed <organization>African National Congress</organization> may be linked
to the coup.
   The <organization>ANC</organization>, based in <location>Lusaka</location>, <location>Zambia</location>, dismissed the claims and said
<location>South Africa</location>'s actions showed that it maintains tight control over
the homeland governments. The group seeks to topple the <location>Pretoria</location>
government.
   The <organization>African National Congress</organization> and other anti-government
organizations consider the homelands part of an apartheid system
designed to fragment the black majority and deny them political
rights in <location>South Africa</location>.

<HEAD>Diplomat, Citing ``Corruption,'' Breaks with Noriega</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Panamanian diplomat broke with his
country's military-dominated government <date>Friday</date>, declaring he could
no longer in good conscience serve a regime stained by
``corruption, illigitimacy and dishonesty.''
   <person>Lawrence Chewning Fabrega</person>, minister counselor at <location>Panama</location>'s
mission to the <organization>Organization of American States</organization> here, told a news
conference his decision to resign was triggered by a speech he was
ordered to give at an <organization>OAS</organization> ceremony on <date>Wednesday</date>.
   <person>Chewning</person> had said in the speech that the <person>Reagan</person> administration
was attempting to overthrow the Panamanian government and was
waging a campaign of ``moral and economic aggresion'' against
<location>Panama</location>.
   ``These remarks were not written by me, nor did they represent
the way I feel or think,'' <person>Chewning</person> said, adding that they were
prepared by <location>Panama</location>'s ambassador to the <organization>OAS</organization>, <person>Roberto Leyton</person>, and the
<organization>Panamanian Foreign Ministry</organization>.
   <person>Chewning</person>'s resignation followed an extraordinary week in which
Panamanian strongman <person>Manuel Antonio Noriega</person> was indicted by two
federal grand juries in <location>Florida</location> on drug-related charges and was
accused by former associates before a congressional panel of
engaging in an array of corrupt activities.
   Speaking through a translator at <organization>OAS</organization> headquarters, <person>Chewning</person>
said: ``My conscience, my dignity and my deep religious beliefs
prevent me from continuing to be used as an instrument of a
government characterized by corruption, illigitimacy and
dishonesty.''
   <location>Panama</location>'s <organization>OAS</organization> mission had no statement on <person>Chewning</person>'s resignation,
and Ambassador <person>Leyton</person> was not available for comment. <person>Gabriel Lewis</person>,
a former Panamanian ambassador who has been lobbying in <location>Washington</location>
against <person>Noriega</person>'s rule, said <person>Chewning</person>'s resignation proves there
are ``worthy individuals'' in the Panamanian government who refuse
to continue supporting <person>Noriega</person>.
   <person>Chewning</person> said he did not resign on the day of the <organization>OAS</organization> ceremony
because he felt it was inappropriate, given the nature of the
event. The occasion was the formal incorporation of <location>West Germany</location>
into an international agreement designed to guarantee the
neutrality of the <location>Panama Canal</location> once the waterway comes under
Panamanian control in the year <date>2000</date>.
   In his speech <date>Wednesday</date>, <person>Chewning</person> had said the <location>United States</location>, in
pursuing a hostile attitude toward the Panamanian government, was
attempting to evade its treaty pledge to relinquish control over
the canal.
   On <date>Friday</date>, he said he believes the <location>United States</location> will faithfully
comply with its commitments.
   <person>Chewning</person> said he was not seeking political asylum in the <location>United
States</location> and was confident he would not be the target of reprisals by
the Panamanian government.
   He will be ineligible to remain in this country because his visa
allowing him to remain here is valid only so long as he maintained
his status as a diplomat. He said he has about a month to decide
what to do in the future.
   <person>Chewning</person>, 46, served in the <organization>OAS</organization> post for a year and a half. He
previously had worked in <location>Panama</location>'s <organization>Foreign Ministry</organization>, its embassy in
<location>Belgium</location> and its embassy in <location>Washington</location> accredited to the <location>U.S.</location>
government.
   He and his wife are expecting their fourth child.

<TEXT>
   <person>Pete du Pont</person>, struggling to keep his
presidential candidacy alive in the final days before the <location>New
Hampshire</location> primary, lashed out <date>Friday</date> at fellow Republicans <person>Bob Dole</person>
and <person>Jack Kemp</person>.
   At a news conference in this snowbound city, <person>du Pont</person> said:
``What <person>Bob Dole</person> says seems to depend on what state he's in.'' He
also called <person>Kemp</person> ``a big spender.''
   With the departure of <person>Alexander Haig</person> from the Republican
presidential race on <date>Friday</date>, <person>du Pont</person>, a former governor of
<location>Delaware</location>, ranks at the bottom of the five-candidate field.
   He conceded that to stay in the race after <date>Tuesday</date>'s primary
``you have to do well. You have to start beating somebody.''
   <organization>Du Pont</organization> had kind words for <person>Haig</person>, a former secretary of state,
calling him ``a credit to this process'' and saying ``he brought a
little spice to the debate.''
   But he had no kind words for anyone else.
   Asked about his prospects, <person>du Pont</person> said, ``All of <location>New
Hampshire</location>'s in flux now that the vice president is in a free fall.''
   Vice President <person>George Bush</person>'s standing as the clear front-runner
among <location>New Hampshire</location> Republicans has eroded since his embarrassing
third-place finish in the <location>Iowa precinct</location> caucuses on <date>Monday</date>.
   <organization>Du Pont</organization> called the upcoming days ``the four most volatile of
this campaign.''
   Focusing on <person>Dole</person>, <person>du Pont</person> said, ``I don't think you can go to
<location>Iowa</location> and talk to farmers about how many dollars you've appropriated
and then come to <location>New Hampshire</location> and avoid it.''
   He also said the <location>Kansas</location> senator had told <organization>Iowans</organization> that he would
not pledge to oppose any tax increases and then came to <location>New
Hampshire</location> and said he would veto a tax increase. <location>New Hampshire</location>
voters have a reputation for solid opposition to tax increases.
   <organization>Du Pont</organization> also said that <person>Dole</person> had supported an import fee on
foreign oil in <location>Iowa</location> but ``in <location>New Hampshire</location> he says he'll veto it.''
   As for <person>Kemp</person>, a congressman from <location>New York</location>, <person>du Pont</person> said, ``He's a
big spender. In fact he's got a spending record in the <organization>Congress</organization>
that is even more liberal than <person>Pat Schroeder</person> (a Democratic
congresswoman from <location>Colorado</location>) or <person>Paul Simon</person> (the <location>Illinois</location> senator
who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination).''
   ``So, I don't think on <date>Tuesday</date> the people of <location>New Hampshire</location> are
going to fall for a snow job,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President <person>Hussain Muhammad Ershad</person> said
<date>Friday</date> he was saddened by the violence in this week's local
elections that left at least 100 people dead, but he added he was
heartened by a heavy voter turnout.
   In a message released by the official <organization>Bangladesh news agency</organization>,
<person>Ershad</person> said he was sorry at ``the loss of valuable lives and
injuries caused to a number of people in some isolated incidents of
violence.''
   At least 100 people were killed and hundreds injured in clashes
among supporters of rival candidates on <date>Wednesday</date>.
   The voting was to elect representatives to more than 4,370
village councils.
   Opposition party leaders Sheik <person>Hasina</person> and <person>Khaleda Zia</person> have
blamed <person>Ershad</person> for the violence and accused the government of
failure to maintain law and order.
   The women have led a series of strikes and protests since <date>Nov.
10</date> to try to oust <person>Ershad</person>.
   <person>Hasina</person>, daughter of assassinated president Sheik <person>Mujibur Rahman</person>,
and Mrs. <person>Zia</person>, wife of another slain president, have called for
general strikes <date>Saturday</date> and <date>Sunday</date> to protest the violence and
renew the call for <person>Ershad</person>'s resignation.
   Ershad on <date>Friday</date> appealed for ``tolerance and patience'' to make
the process of democracy a success.
   ``The enthusiasm and spontaneous participation of the people in
the polls was the manifestation of peoples' firm confidence in the
constitutional process and democratic norms,'' <person>Ershad</person>'s statement
said.
   According to government reports, voter turnout was as high as <percent>80
percent</percent> in areas where there was no violence.
   <person>Poling</person> was postponed in at least 2,500 of 21,000 voting centers
because of election-day clashes. A new date for polling had not yet
been set.
   The list of successful candidates is expected to be ready in
about a week, government officials say.
   <person>Ershad</person>, 58, assumed power in a bloodless coup in <date>1982</date>. He won
election to the presidency in <date>1986</date> in balloting the opposition
contends was rigged.
   In an effort to appease the opposition, he dissolved <organization>Parliament</organization>
and called for new elections <date>Feb. 3</date>. The opposition called for a
boycott, contending the balloting would not be free and fair.

<HEAD>Son Challenges Justice Department To Admit It Wrongly Extradited
Father</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of a man who lived nearly 40 years in
the <location>United States</location> and then died in a Yugoslav prison after being
convicted of Nazi war crimes challenged <location>U.S.</location> officials <date>Friday</date> to
admit they wrongly extradited his father to a communist court.
   <person>Rad Artukovic</person>, in a 135-page report submitted to the <organization>Justice
Department</organization>, said the department used fraudulent evidence to send
his father, <person>Andrija Artukovic</person>, to face a ``sham trial'' in
<location>Yugoslavia</location> two years ago.
   The elder <person>Artukovic</person> died last month at age 88 while awaiting
execution in a Yugoslav prison.
   ``The only way the <location>U. S.</location> government could get him was through
fraud,'' <person>Artukovic</person> told a news conference before leaving for <location>Los
Angeles</location> to join a federal courthouse vigil in honor of his late
father.
   He said his father has become a hero to people from his native
<location>Croatia</location>, now a part of <location>Yugoslavia</location>.
   <person>Andrija Artukovic</person>, who was a cabinet minister in the Nazi puppet
state of <location>Croatia</location>, was called ``Butcher of the Balkans'' by the
Yugoslav government and accused of ordering the deaths of thousands
of people. During his trial, he was described as as overseer of a
grisly network of concentration camps.
   <person>Rad Artukovic</person>, 39, said his father was minister of the interior,
had no military responsibilities and ordered no deaths.
   He said his father was not mentally competent to stand trial.
<location>U.S.</location> officials had declared him senile and legally blind when he
was extradited.
   <person>Tom Stewart</person>, spokesman for the <organization>Justice Department</organization>'s criminal
division, said a copy of <person>Artukovic</person>'s report had been received by
the <organization>Office of Special Investigations</organization> and was being reviewed by
investigators who handle allegations of war crimes.
   ``He's done a marvelous job of defending his father's
reputation, but the matter was dealt with in the courts,'' <person>Stewart</person>
said.
   <person>Artukovic</person> said in the report that both his father's extradition
and the trial in <location>Zagreb</location> relied mainly on false testimony from <location>Bajro
Avdic</location>, a man who claimed to have been a military escort for his
father.
   The report said <person>Avdic</person> was not an escort and was not in the
places he claimed to be when atrocities allegedly occurred. It also
claims he made up the killings attributed to <location>Artukovic</location>.
   ``I ask the <organization>Justice Department</organization> to go into court and revoke the
order they obtained through fraud,'' <person>Artukovic</person> said, accusing <location>U.S.</location>
officials of collusion with the communist government in <location>Yugoslavia</location>.
   <person>Artukovic</person> said he hopes for a renunciation of the extradition to
invalidate the Yugoslav trial.
   <person>Artukovic</person> said he and two of his four sisters visited their
father during his imprisonment in <location>Yugoslavia</location> but his mother, <person>Ana</person>,
never saw her husband after he was extradited. The family lives in
<location>Seal Beach</location>, <location>Calif.</location> His father for many years had been a bookkeeper
for a <location>Los Angeles</location> construction company.
   The younger <person>Artukovic</person>, a stock trader, said he worked for two
years to research the report on what he said was false evidence
against his father and is sending copies to members of the <organization>Senate
Judiciary Committee</organization> and the <organization>Senate Foreign Relations Committee</organization>.
   He said the <organization>Justice Department</organization> went along with whatever was
given it by the Yugoslavian government but could not collect enough
evidence to deport his father.
   <person>Artukovic</person> said <location>Yugoslavia</location> accused his father of war crimes to
neutralize him as a Croatian political leader. He said most other
members of the Croatian wartime cabinet were executed as war
criminals but <organization>Allied</organization> officials found no evidence against him and he
was allowed to live freely in <location>Ireland</location> and later the <location>United States</location>.

   Slippery, ice-covered roads and
snarled traffic helped four people escape from a man who abducted
them at gunpoint and took their cars, police said <date>Friday</date>.
   <person>Larry F. Johnson</person>, 43, of <person>Logansport</person>, <location>Ind.</location>, was arraigned on four
counts of kidnapping in <organization>Warren District Court</organization> after his arrest in
the cases early <date>Friday</date>. He was being held without bond in the
<organization>Warren County Jail</organization>, police said.
   He also was wanted in <location>Georgia</location>, <location>South Carolina</location>, <location>Tennessee</location>,
<location>Indiana</location> and <location>Kentucky</location> on various charges, including assaulting a
police officer in <location>Georgia</location>, kidnapping, theft and drug-related
charges, said Trooper <person>Jackie Strode</person>.
   <person>Johnson</person> was traveling on foot and was not armed when he was
arrested, <person>Strode</person> said.
   <person>Strode</person> said <person>Erwin Quirand</person>, of <location>Knoxville</location>, <location>Tenn.</location>, and a
17-year-old girl from <person>Sumter</person>, <location>S.C.</location>, jumped from a northbound car
<date>Thursday</date> on <location>Interstate 65</location> while traffic was slowed past the site of
a multi-vehicle car-truck pileup in which one person was killed.
They ran to police and said they had been kidnapped.
   <person>Quirand</person> said he had been kidnapped him and his car taken
<date>Wednesday</date> at a <location>Knoxville</location>, <location>Tenn.</location>, grocery store. He told <organization>WBKO-TV</organization> in
<location>Bowling Green</location> that his abductor said he was ``running for his
life.'' The juvenile said she and her car were taken <date>Tuesday</date>.
   The man sped away but crashed the car four miles north of the
accident scene, <person>Strode</person> said.
   The man then stopped a pickup truck driven by <person>Daniel Eidson Jr.</person>,
18, of <location>Bowling Green</location>, and asked <person>Eidson</person> and his passenger, <person>Greg
Bell</person>, 21, of <person>Richardsville</person>, for a ride to get a wrecker.
   But when they pulled into a service station, <person>Eidson</person> said, the
man pulled out a gun and said: ``I'm in a little trouble with the
law. Keep going.''
   The man then took the wheel but slid off an icy road into a
ditch, <person>Eidson</person> said.
   The three walked to a house and the man tried to persuade
someone there to give him a ride to <location>Nashville</location>, but was turned down,
<person>Eidson</person> said.
   He said the three then went to the home of <person>Susan and Gary Comer</person>,
where the man asked to borrow their tractor to pull the truck out
of the ditch.
   Mrs. <person>Comer</person> refused, <person>Eidson</person> said, and the gunman then demanded
her car and ripped a telephone cord out of the wall.
   ``I told them the keys were in the car,'' Mrs. <person>Comer</person> said.
   Her car slid off another road, and <organization>Bell</organization> and <person>Eidson</person> escaped while
pushing it out of a ditch, <person>Eidson</person> said.
   The gunman later wrecked that car and police lost his trail
until running across him early <date>Friday</date> about six miles south of
<location>Bowling Green</location>, <person>Strode</person> said.
   He had been described by <location>Indiana</location> authorities as suicidal and
wanting vengeance against police officers, <person>Strode</person> said.
   <person>Eidson</person> said he was afraid during the incident.
   ``I didn't really know'' what the man would do, he said. ``But
he had a gun, you know, and he kept pulling it out.''

   A court on <date>Friday</date> convicted fugitive guerrilla
leader <person>Abu Nidal</person> and two of his Palestinian followers in the <date>1985</date>
grenade and rifle attack that killed 16 people in a crowd of
holiday travelers at <location>Rome</location>'s airport.
   <person>Abu Nidal</person> and another fugitive, <person>Rashid el-Hamieda</person>, were
sentenced to life in prison. The only defendant in custody, <person>Mahmoud
Ibrahim Khaled</person>, was given a 30-year term.
   More than 80 people were injured in the <date>Dec. 27, 1985</date> assault on
the check-in counters of <organization>TWA</organization> and the Israeli carrier <organization>El Al</organization> at
<person>Leonardo da Vinci</person> airport.
   Four Americans were killed, including an 11-year-old girl on a
trip with her family to <location>New York</location>.
   <person>El-Hamieda</person>, described as a top lieutenant in <person>Abu Nidal</person>'s <organization>Fatah
Revolutionary Council</organization>, was accused along with <person>Abu Nidal</person> of
organizing the attack. Neither he nor <person>Abu Nidal</person> took part in it.
   The assault occurred at the same hour as a similar strike at
<location>Vienna</location>'s airport, also blamed on <person>Abu Nidal</person>'s followers.
   Four people, including two terrorists and an American, died in
the <location>Vienna</location> attack, and 47 people were injured. Two surviving
Palestinian terrorists were convicted of murder by a <location>Vienna</location> jury
and sentenced to life in prison.
   The <location>Rome</location> jury of two judges and six civilians apparently heeded
a plea for leniency for <person>Khaled</person>, the only survivor of the four-man
commando team. He could be released on parole in a little less than
15 years.
   Earlier in the day, his court-appointed lawyer said he could not
possibly ask for acquittal for the 20-year-old <person>Khaled</person>, who admitted
his guilt.
   Instead, the lawyer, <person>Epifanio Ales</person>, reread for the jury <person>Khaled</person>'s
own statements about his childhood in a refugee camp in <location>Lebanon</location>,
his parents' death in an Israeli bombing and his taking up of arms
when he was 10 years old.
   <person>Khaled</person> was ``a patriot who wanted a <location>Palestine</location> free of the
Israelis,'' <person>Ales</person> said in his plea for mercy.
   The lawyer asked the jury to remember that Italian courts, for
years, were merciful to men who had killed adulterous wives and
their lovers under a now vanishing ``crime of honor'' standard.
   <person>Ales</person> said defending the confessed terrorist was ``an anguished
task'' and that it was particularly painful to listen to the
testimony of an American journalist about how his daughter,
11-year-old <person>Natasha Simpson</person>, died in the gunfire.
   <person>Victor L. Simpson</person>, news editor for <organization>The Associated Press</organization> in <location>Rome</location>,
described in court how he threw himself and the girl to the
terminal floor in a futile attempt to shield her from the bullets.
   According to the trial indictment, four Israeli security guards
fired back, killing three of the four members of the attack squad
and wounding <person>Khaled</person>.
   The steel-barred holding cage for <person>Khaled</person> was empty on <date>Friday</date>. He
chose to stay in his prison cell, exercising his right under
Italian law not to attend his trial. He only attended court <date>Dec.
15</date>, the trial's opening session.
   The trial was based largely on hours of pre-trial statements by
<person>Khaled</person>, who told investigators that the terrorists were trained in
<location>Lebanon</location>'s Syrian-controlled <location>Bekaa Valley</location> and took their orders from
headquarters in <location>Damascus</location>, the Syrian capital.
   Investigators believed <person>el-Hamieda</person> provided the terrorists with
their weapons and gave them final instructions during several
meetings in <location>Rome</location>, then checked out of a hotel and fled <location>Italy</location> at
virtually the same hour the raid was launched.
   Prosecutor <person>Francesco Deleo</person> had requested conviction and life
sentences for the three defendants, saying <person>Khaled</person>'s statements made
clear the airport strikes were linked to several terrorist attacks
in <location>Europe</location> this decade.
   <location>Italy</location> does not have capital punishment.
   <person>Abu Nidal</person>'s group has been blamed for more than 100 attacks
across <location>Europe</location>, <location>Asia</location> and the <location>Middle East</location> since <date>1972</date>.
   He split from <person>Yasser Arafat</person>'s <organization>Palestine Liberation Organization</organization>
in <date>1973</date>.
   An international arrest warrant has been issued for <person>Abu Nidal</person>,
whose real name is <person>Sabri al-Banna</person>.
   <person>Abu Nidal</person> is a nom de guerre which means ``father of the
struggle.''
   He originally based his group in <location>Syria</location> but was expelled and is
believed to operate out of <location>Lebanon</location>, with his followers trained in
<location>Libya</location>.
   Lawyers for both fugitive defendants asked the jury for
acquittal for lack of evidence. They said they would appeal the
verdict.
   <person>Khaled</person>'s lawyer said he had not yet decided about an appeal.
   All three defendants were charged with massacre and with illegal
possession of arms.

<TEXT>
   About 15,000 reservists, civilian
militia, police and regular army troops will take part soon in
civil defense and military maneuvers, the <organization>Sandinista</organization> newspaper
<organization>Barricada</organization> announced <date>Friday</date>.
   <person>Barricada</person> said the civilians and military personnel will
participate in the exercises in <location>Managua</location> and its surrounding region.
It did not specify on what day they would begin.
   The maneuvers come at a time of high tension in the city of
<person>Masaya</person>, about 20 miles southeast of <location>Managua</location>, where demonstrators
opposing the government's obligatory military draft clashed with
<organization>Sandinista</organization> supporters and police on <date>Monday</date> and <date>Tuesday</date>.
   Club-wielding <organization>Sandinista</organization> demonstrators first sought to quash the
protests in the streets. Police later intervened to break up the
demonstrations, and <organization>Interior</organization> Minister <person>Tomas Borge</person> arrived to
monitor the situation.
   The exercises ``are of a routine nature and are called for under
the annual plans to prepare the people in defense,'' <person>Barricada</person>
said. It added that participating Sandinista police would patrol
``centers of greater criminal incidences.''
   The <organization>Regional Committee of the Sandinista National Liberation
Front</organization>, the government party, told <person>Barricada</person> the maneuvers would
involve peasant militia, factory and neighborhood reservists and
mass organizations.
   <organization>Neighborhood Sandinista Defense Committees</organization> and <organization>Sandinista Youth
organization</organization> members also will take part.
   <organization>Sandinista army</organization> troops staged maneuvers at the same time last
year, but few civilians participated.
   <person>Borge</person> referred indirectly to the <location>Masaya</location> demonstrations <date>Thursday</date>,
saying he had instructed Sandinista police to act ``with profound
respect for the physical integrity of those who provoke them, but
at the same time with energy and without vacillation in order to
impede vandalism and disorder in the country.''

<TEXT>
   Empty <location>Bullfrog County</location>, created from
scrubland in a bid to assure the state of federal dollars should
the government build a nuclear dump in <location>Nevada</location>, violates the state
constitution, a judge has ruled.
   Judge <person>David Zenoff</person> said <date>Thursday</date> the county stretched its legal
limits ``every which way,'' and left too many constitutional issues
``hanging in the air.''
   <location>Nye County</location>, from which unpopulated <location>Bullfrog County</location> was carved,
had challenged the <date>1987</date> <organization>Legislature</organization>'s creation of the state's 18th
county.
   <person>Zenoff</person>, a former state <organization>Supreme Court</organization> justice brought in to hear
the case, issued the ruling after less than 30 minutes of oral
arguments in district court.
   <person>Zenoff</person> said the governor's authority to appoint three
commissioners for the county ran ``contrary to the democratic
process,'' and contributed to its failure to provide representative
government.
   ``I cannot in good conscience uphold this law,'' he said.
   ``Obviously, we're very pleased,'' said <location>Nye County</location> District
Attorney <person>Phil Dunleavy</person>. ``It confirms what we've been saying all
along. As far as I'm concerned, <location>Bullfrog County</location> is dead and it
should be.''
   Attorney <person>Frank Daykin</person>, representing the <organization>Legislature</organization> and <location>Bullfrog
County</location>, said it would be up to the <organization>Legislative Commission</organization> to decide
whether to appeal <person>Zenoff</person>'s ruling to the state <organization>Supreme Court</organization>.
   The commission's next meeting is scheduled for <date>Wednesday</date>.
   ``We usually don't accept defeat in the <organization>Legislature</organization>,'' said
<organization>commission</organization> Chairman <person>Lawrence Jacobsen</person>.
   Legislators created the county out of a 144-square-mile chunk of
<location>Nye County</location> as a way of giving the state control over federal funds
available for the proposed. <organization>Yucca Mountain</organization> in southern <location>Nevada</location> is
one of three sites under consideration.
   Had <location>Bullfrog County</location> been selected, the <location>U.S.</location> government would
have had to compensate the state-run county an estimated <money>$8 million</money>
to <money>$25 million</money> a year, officials said.
   ``Personally, I hope the <organization>Legislature</organization> doesn't appeal it because
it's brought enough embarrassment to <location>Nevada</location> and should be allowed
to lay in peace,'' <person>Dunleavy</person> said. ``The <organization>Legislature</organization> needs to
rethink its approach to the problem.''
   <location>Nye County</location> stands to lose revenue should the new county remain
on the books.
   Gov. <person>Richard Bryan</person>, who signed the law creating the county into
effect, issued only a brief statement upon learning of <person>Zenoff</person>'s
decision.
   ``This apparently resolves the <location>Bullfrog County</location> issue unless the
<organization>Legislature</organization> chooses to appeal,'' he said.
   <person>Karen Zupon</person>, the governor's press secretary, said <person>Bryan</person> ``has
always said he'll abide by the court's decision. He's not a party
to the suit and he hasn't said anything about whether he thinks it
should be appealed.''
   <location>Nye County</location> challenged the county's creation on 37 different
legal grounds in a 92-page brief. Its major complaint was <location>Bullfrog
County</location>'s failure to provide representative government.
   <person>Zenoff</person> agreed, saying it was not ``answerable to the people.''
Among other things, he said the law made no provisions for a
judicial district or legislative representation for the county.

<HEAD>Shultz Sets Middle East Peace Trip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of <organization>State</organization> <person>George P. Shultz</person> will go to
the <location>Middle East</location> in two weeks to try to promote two-stage
negotiations between <location>Israel</location> and <location>Jordan</location> on Palestinian self-rule.
   A brief <organization>State Department</organization> announcement <date>Friday</date> said <person>Shultz</person> would
make the trip at the end of the month ``for the purpose of
advancing the <location>Middle East</location> peace process.''
   Other <location>U.S.</location> officials said he would set out for the <location>Middle East</location>
about 24 hours after returning from <date>Feb. 21-23</date> talks in <location>Mosocw</location> and
visit <location>Egypt</location>, <location>Jordan</location>, <location>Israel</location> and possibly <location>Saudi Arabia</location>.
   <person>Shultz</person> plans to remain in the area until he joins President
<person>Reagan</person> for a summit meeting with the leaders of the 15 <organization>North
Atlantic Treaty Organization</organization> countries in <location>Brussels</location> beginning <date>March
2</date>.
   The Soviets have been notified in advance that <person>Shultz</person> intends to
sound out Foreign Minister <person>Eduard A. Shevardnadze</person> about an
international peace conference that would be a backdrop for
Arab-Israeli negotiations.
   Their <location>Moscow</location> talks will center mostly on prospects for a treaty
to sharply reduce <location>U.S.</location> and Soviet long-range nuclear missiles and
for a withdrawal of the <organization>Red Army</organization> from <location>Afghanistan</location> after an
occupation of more than eight years.
   Israeli Prime Minister <person>Yitzhak Shamir</person> and <person>Shultz</person> have registered
their reluctance to having the Soviets play a prominent role in a
<location>Middle East</location> settlement. But <person>Jordan</person>'s King <person>Hussein</person> wants the
participation of all the big powers, including <location>Moscow</location>.
   According to <location>U.S.</location> and other sources who declined to be
identified, <person>Shultz</person> will advance a two-step plan that would open
negotiations in <date>April</date> between <location>Israel</location> and a mixed
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation and then resume in <date>December</date> to
work on an overall <location>Middle East</location> settlement.
   All options, including statehood for the Palestinians, would be
open at that point.
   <person>Shultz</person> reaffirmed <date>Monday</date> night in a meeting with American
foreign policy experts that the <location>U.S.</location> approach to a final settlement
is based on <location>Israel</location> trading territory for peace.
   That could cause severe political problems for <person>Shamir</person> because
many of his supporters are against relinquishing land the Arabs
lost to <location>Israel</location> in the <date>1967</date> Six-Day War.
   At the same time, the <location>United States</location> has not endorsed Palestinian
statehood. President <person>Reagan</person>'s formula, outlined in a <date>1982</date> speech
and still <location>U.S.</location> policy, proposed linking the <location>West Bank</location> and <location>Gaza</location> to
<location>Jordan</location>.
   <person>Reagan</person> said flatly that the <location>United States</location> ``will not support the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state'' in the
territories and would also ``not support annexation or permanent
control by <location>Israel</location>.''
   <person>Shultz</person>'s trip is designed to show a commitment to aiding the 1.5
million Palestinian Arabs who live on the <location>West Bank</location> and in <location>Gaza</location> and
to ending violence in the Israeli-held territories.
   Sources said <person>Shultz</person>'s overriding goal was to promote
negotiations between <location>Israel</location> and the Arabs, possibly in the
framework of a <location>Mideast</location> peace conference.
   They stressed that the framework was incidental to holding
direct talks on the Palestinian issue and that all approaches to
getting the two sides to the table would be considered.
   The peace conference idea has drawn objections from <person>Shamir</person>, but
it has the support of Israeli Foreign Minister <person>Shimon Peres</person>, and
possibly King <person>Hussein</person>.
   On his last visit to the region in <date>October</date>, <person>Shultz</person> said he
understood why <person>Shamir</person> would be reluctant to hold negotations in a
way that gave the <location>Soviet Union</location> a chance to play an influential role.
   The Soviets generally side with the Arabs in their dispute with
<location>Israel</location> and do not have diplomatic relations with <location>Jerusalem</location>.
   About <percent>96 percent</percent> of the residents of the <location>West Bank</location> and <location>Gaza</location> are
Palestinian Arabs. Jewish settlers who were banned from the <location>West
Bank</location> during <person>Jordan</person>'s control from <date>1948</date> to <date>1967</date> have established
villages, religious schools and synagogues there.
   <person>Hussein</person> has accused the <person>Reagan</person> administration of being
hopelessly one-sided toward <location>Israel</location>. But a recent <location>U.S.</location> diplomatic
emissary, <person>Philip C. Habib</person>, was reported to have detected a
``positive'' attitude in talks with the king in <location>Amman</location>.
   Assistant Secretary of <organization>State</organization> <person>Richard W. Murphy</person> returned from the
<location>Middle East</location> on <date>Thursday</date> and reported to <person>Shultz</person> on his meetings with
leaders of <location>Syria</location>, <location>Saudia Arabia</location>, <location>Egypt</location> and <location>Israel</location>, as well as with
British and French officials.

   The government should ease back on acreage

Growers</person> said <date>Friday</date>.
   <person>Frank Johannsen</person>, association president, said greater acreage
should be permitted so the United States can keep filling a growing

required to idle <percent>27.5 percent</percent> of their base acreage in order to
qualify for federal supports.
   The <organization>Agriculture Department</organization> is to announce the <date>1989</date> wheat program
by <date>June 1</date>. <person>Johannsen</person>, a wheat farmer from <person>Bayard</person>, <location>Neb.</location>, said the

percent</percent>.
   <person>Johannsen</person> said <location>U.S.</location> wheat stockpiles are expected to drop by <percent>30
percent</percent> this season, the largest annual decline in more than 20
years.
   A <date>1989</date> acreage reduction of less than <percent>20 percent</percent> could be
justified if <organization>USDA</organization> maintains its current export subsidy programs, he
said.
   ``Since we don't know what will happen after the <date>November</date>

said in a statement.

<TEXT>
   A member of <location>Israel</location>'s <organization>Parliament</organization> arrived in
<location>Athens</location> on <date>Friday</date> to join Palestinian deportees in a planned voyage
back to <location>Israel</location>, but two organizers said they still had not obtained
a ship.
   The president of <location>Greece</location>'s main seamen's union, meanwhile, said
Israeli agents had used threats and pressure to block the
<organization>PLO</organization>-sponsored trip that would carry <location>130 Palestians</location> deported by
<location>Israel</location> to the Israeli port of <location>Haifa</location>.
   Union leader <person>Antonis Dalakogiorgis</person> also revealed that the
<organization>Israeli Sea Officers Union</organization> had warned they would boycott Greek
vessels if Greek seamen continued backing the <organization>PLO</organization> effort.
   The ``journey of return'' is designed to focus attention on
<location>Israel</location>'s use of deportations to punish Palestinians in the
territories it captured in the <date>1967</date> Arab-Israeli war.
   <organization>Parliament</organization> member <person>Mohammed Miari</person> appeared at a news conference
at an <location>Athens</location> hotel alongside <person>Bassam Abu Sharif</person>, the chief spokesman
for <organization>PLO</organization> Chairman <person>Yasser Arafat</person>.
   <person>Miari</person>, a member of the left-wing <organization>Progressive List for Peace</organization>,
said he was told that ``the Israeli government will put on trial
all those who participate in the trip,'' and said there were moves
in <organization>Parliament</organization> to strip him of his parliamentary immunity.
   Two other <organization>parliament</organization> members, <person>Tawfiq Zaiad</person> and <person>Charlie Biton</person>,
were among 11 Israelis who arrived <date>Thursday</date> in <location>Cyprus</location> to join the
voyage when it stops there. About 20 Israelis plan to make the trip.
   The trip is modeled after the voyage of the Exodus, which tried
to take Jewish refugees to <location>Palestine</location> in <date>1947</date> but was turned back by
British authorities. <person>Miriam Algazi</person>, one of the Israelis who arrived
in <location>Cyprus</location> on <date>Thursday</date>, also took part in the Exodus voyage.
   At the news conference, <person>Miari</person> backed ``the right of the deported
Palestinians people to return to their homeland.''
   He said he hoped the trip would ``open a new window for just
peace in the <location>Middle East</location>.''
   But there was increasing doubt that any ship would be able to
sail soon, although the <organization>PLO</organization> has gathered hundreds of deportees,
observers and journalists in <location>Athens</location> and <location>Cyprus</location> to take part.
   Two members of the nine-member voyage steering committee in
<location>Athens</location> told <organization>The Associated Press</organization> that the <organization>PLO</organization> did not have a firm
contract to charter a vessel because several companies had backed
out of tentative commitments.
   ``We don't have a boat yet,'' said <person>Abdul-Jawad Saleh</person>, the
deported mayor of the <location>West Bank</location> town of <location>Bireh</location>.
   ``There is not a concrete ship as of this moment,'' said another
member of the steering committee who insisted on anonymity.
   The voyage was initially scheduled to start on <date>Tuesday</date>, but the
<organization>PLO</organization> diplomatic representative in <location>Athens</location>, <organization>Fouad Al-Bittar</organization>, said
<date>Thursday</date> the voyage had been delayed because ``many'' <person>shipowners</person>
had backed away from contracts.
   However, he then promised that the voyage would begin by early
<date>Saturday</date> morning from <location>Greece</location>'s main <location>Piraeus</location> harbor, saying a boat
had been found.
   ``We are still insisting that the boat will sail,'' <person>Abu Sharif</person>
said <date>Friday</date>. He reaffirmed the time schedule given by <person>Bittar</person>, but
added an element of uncertainty.
   ``I'm sure we will find _ and have found, according to Mr.
<person>Bittar</person> _ a brave captain'' for the voyage, he said.
   <location>Piraeus</location> harbor authority officials said at <time>noon</time> <date>Friday</date> the <organization>PLO</organization>
had not submitted documents legally required 24 hours before a ship
can be brought in or out.
   <person>Dalakogiorgis</person>, president of the <organization>Panhellenic Union of Merchant
Seamen</organization>, said that ``Israeli agents'' had threatened Greek shipping
companies and individual seamen about the voyage.
   ``<person>Seamen</person> working on ships that the <organization>PLO</organization> might have chartered
received telephone threats from the Israelis and shipping companies
were also under intense pressure from them,'' <person>Dalakogiorgis</person> said.
   ``I personally received threatening phone calls, threatening my
life, not to proceed with this,'' <person>Dalakogiorgis</person> said.
   <person>Dalakogiorgis</person> distributed copies of a telex from the <organization>Israeli Sea
Officers Union</organization> saying ``we would have no choice but to boycott
Greek vessels in Israeli ports'' if the voyage goes as planned.
   No one from the Israeli union, headquartered in <location>Haifa</location>, could be
found for comment <date>Friday</date>.
   Shipping sources in <location>Piraeus</location>, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the captain of the first ship chartered to make the voyage had
also been threatened.
   They said that <person>Zannes Kouloumbis</person> of the Maltese-flagged <person>Silver
Paloma</person> was warned of an Israeli attack during the voyage and told
his life was in danger.
   The ship's owners, who operate a regular ferry service to
<location>Israel</location>, dropped out.

   Two <organization>U.S. Navy</organization> warships, under orders to assert
international navigation rights, were deliberately bumped by two
Soviet warships on <date>Friday</date> after moving within 12 miles of <location>Russia</location>'s
<location>Black Sea</location> coastline, the <organization>Pentagon</organization> said.
   No one was injured and damage to the two ships was described as
light.
   But the administration immediately lodged a strong protest with
the Soviet ambassador here, saying the vessels had done nothing
provocative and were operating in accord with international law.
   ``As Secretary of State (<person>George P.) Shultz</person> said just a week ago,
we are prepared to deal with the best and worst of Soviet
behavior,'' said <person>Rudolph Boone</person>, a <organization>State Department</organization> spokesman.
   ``We intend to continue exercising our rights under
international law. The Soviets are obligated to comply with their
international commitments.''
   <organization>Navy</organization> officials said during a <organization>Pentagon</organization> briefing there was no
question that the cruiser USS <location>Yorktown</location> and destroyer USS <person>Caron</person> had
been struck deliberately by a Soviet frigate and a smaller coastal
patrol boat, respectively.
   The Soviet warships broadcast a warning beforehand, saying they
were authorized ``to strike your ship with one of ours,'' said
Capt. <person>Gerry Flynn</person>, a top aide to the chief of naval operations.
   The two Soviet ships then closed almost simultaneously on the
American vessels, ``which were, as we would say in the <organization>Navy</organization>,
shouldered out of the way,'' <person>Flynn</person> added.
   The <location>Yorktown</location> and <person>Caron</person> maintained their course and speed despite
the bumping, eventually steaming farther from the Soviet coast,
<person>Flynn</person> said.
   ``The latest report I have now is that both ships are operating
routinely in the <location>Black Sea</location> as planned,'' he said.
   <person>Flynn</person> and other <organization>Pentagon</organization> officials said they could not recall a
similar incident of deliberate bumping during operations in the
<location>Black Sea</location>. The Soviets strongly protested a similar deployment by
the same two ships in <date>March 1986</date>, but did nothing at the time to
physically interfere with their passage.
   The <location>Soviet Union</location> claimed <date>Friday</date> the <organization>U.S. Navy</organization> ships violated its
border, ignored warnings ``and dangerously maneuvered in Soviet
territorial waters.''
   ``It was a routine passage and we were doing nothing provocative
at all ...,'' <person>Flynn</person> countered. ``We view (this) with considerable
concern.''
   According to Cmdr. <person>Richard Schiff</person>, a <organization>Navy</organization> lawyer who appeared
with <person>Flynn</person>, the <location>Yorktown</location> and <person>Caron</person> were operating off the Crimean
peninsula in what the <organization>Navy</organization> calls its ``assertion of rights''
program _ an effort to periodically steam through contested waters
to emphasize freedom of navigation on the high seas.
   Unlike the <location>United States</location>, which claims a three-mile territorial
limit, the <location>Soviet Union</location> claims a 12-mile limit along its coast,
<person>Schiff</person> explained. The <location>United States</location> will accept such a claim, but
any country claiming 12 miles ``must allow for innocent passage by
the ships of all nations,'' he said.
   The <location>Soviet Union</location> tries to insist that foreign ships stick to
specified sea lanes when making an innocent passage, something it
has no right to do, the lawyer said.
   ``So what our ships were doing there was exercising that right
of innocent passage,'' <person>Schiff</person> said. He noted that Soviet
intelligence-gathering ships routinely operate within five miles of
the <location>U.S.</location> coastline.
   According to the <organization>Pentagon</organization>, <date>Friday</date>'s incident began with the
<location>Yorktown</location> and <person>Caron</person> steaming eastward, parallel to each other and
about three miles apart, past the Crimean peninsula. The <person>Caron</person> was
about seven miles off the shoreline and the <location>Yorktown</location> about 10.
   The two ships had been shadowed by three Soviet vessels and
Soviet reconnaissance aircraft ever since entering the <location>Black Sea</location>
through the <organization>Turkish Straits</organization> on <date>Wednesday</date>.
   At about <time>11 a.m. local time</time> <date>Friday</date> _ or <time>3 a.m. EST</time> _ <person>Flynn</person> said
the Soviets broadcast the following warning to the <location>U.S.</location> ships:
``Soviet ships have orders to prevent violation of territorial
waters. I am authorized to strike your ship with one of ours.''
   The <person>Caron</person> responded: ``I am engaged in innocent passage,
consistent with international law.''
   When neither the Caron or <location>Yorktown</location> changed course, a
Krivak-class frigate moved up on the <location>Yorktown</location> and a Mirka-class
patrol vessel moved on the <person>Caron</person>, ``grazing'' the left sides of the
each, <person>Flynn</person> said.
   American naval forays into the <location>Black Sea</location> _ each of which must be
approved by the president _ are normally ordered at least once a
year for two reasons, said <organization>Pentagon</organization> officials who asked not to be
named.
   The <organization>Navy</organization> ships are expected to monitor Soviet military
operations, frequently employing electronic listening gear, and to
assert the right of <location>U.S.</location> warships to navigate through those waters.
   The <location>Soviet Union</location> considers the <location>Black Sea</location> as its own ``lake'' _
even though it is only one of several nations bordering the sea's
waters _ and maintains a large naval fleet there.
   According to <person>Boone</person>, Undersecretary of <organization>State</organization> <person>Michael Armacost</person>
called in Soviet Ambassador <person>Yuri Dubinin</person> <date>Friday</date> morning to ``lodge
a strong protest.''
   <organization>Defense</organization> Secretary <person>Frank C. Carlucci</person>, who is scheduled to meet
with his Soviet counterpart next month, also intends to protest the
Russian action, <person>Boone</person> said.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <organization>Kremlin</organization> accused the <organization>U.S. State Department</organization> on
<date>Friday</date> of spreading ``malicious slanders'' about human rights in
the <location>Soviet Union</location> and said the <location>United States</location> has violations of its
own.
   The official news agency <organization>Tass</organization> carried an interview with <person>Alexei
Glukhov</person> of the <organization>Foreign Ministry</organization> in which he discussed the <organization>State
Department</organization>'s annual report on human rights around the world.
   The report, released <date>Wednesday</date> in <location>Washington</location>, said the Soviet
government gave its people greater freedom and showed more
tolerance toward dissenters in <date>1987</date>. But it said an all-powerful
secret police force remained unchecked.
   <organization>Tass</organization> said the report ``again contains malicious slanders against
the socialist countries, including the <location>U.S.S.R.</location>''
   <person>Glukhov</person>, first deputy head of the <organization>Foreign Ministry</organization>'s <organization>Directorate</organization>
for <organization>Humanitarian and Cultural Issues</organization>, accused the <organization>State Department</organization>
of making the allegations to speed up ratification of the
intermediate-range nuclear weapons treaty, which is making its way
through the <organization>Senate</organization>.
   President <person>Reagan</person> and Soviet leader <person>Mikhail S. Gorbachev</person> signed
the treaty in <date>December</date>.
   The <location>Soviet Union</location>, <person>Glukhov</person> noted, conducted a prison amnesty and
introduced new rules on emigration and immigration last year. The
<organization>State Department</organization> ignored these steps and relied on faulty
information for its report, he charged.
   ``Much of the specific information contained in that report is
clearly drawn from unclean sources,'' he said, citing what he said
was an exaggerated figure of 400 political prisoners in the <location>U.S.S.R.</location>
   ``Obviously, the <organization>U.S. State Department</organization> again lacks simple
objectivity and simple truthfulness in the evaluations,'' he said.
   The <location>Soviet Union</location> would like to know why the <location>United States</location> has
political prisoners, sentences minors to death and prosecutes
clergymen for anti-war activities, <person>Glukhov</person> said.
   ``The <location>U.S.</location> side is far from the measure of openness and
self-criticism demonstrated by the <location>Soviet Union</location> on that issue,'' he
said, referring to human rights.
   Secretary of <organization>State</organization> <person>George P. Shultz</person> and Soviet Foreign Minister
<person>Eduard A. Shevardnadze</person> are to discuss human rights at a meeting in
<location>Moscow</location> on <date>Feb. 21-23</date>.

<TEXT>
   Nuclear test-ban negotiations, resuming next
week in <location>Geneva</location>, are making progress toward means of verifying two
unratified test ban treaties, the <organization>White House</organization> said <date>Friday</date>.
   In a statement, spokesman <person>Marlin Fitzwater</person> said the talks, which
begin again <date>Monday</date>, ``represent a practical approach _ as the
president has long advocated _ to nuclear testing limitations which
are in our national security interest.''
   <person>Fitzwater</person> said the <location>United States</location> and the <location>Soviet Union</location> agreed in
undertaking the talks that the first step should be to negotiate
effective verification measures for the <organization>Threshold Test Ban Treaty</organization>
and the <organization>Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty</organization>.
   The two pacts, limiting the magnitude of certain nuclear tests,
were negotiated in the <date>1970s</date>, but ratification has been withheld
because of concerns about how Soviet compliance could be verified.
   ``Once our verification concerns have been satisfied and the
treaties ratified, we will propose that the <location>United States</location> and the
<location>Soviet Union</location> immediately enter into negotiations on ways to
implement a step-by-step program _ in association with a program to
reduce and ultimately eliminate nuclear weapons _ of limiting and
ultimately ending nuclear testing,'' the spokesman said.
   ``We are making progress toward our goal of effective
verification,'' he added.
   ``With a better understanding of the practical problems
associated with conducting these experiments, we now have the
information needed to design the experiments,'' <person>Fitzwater</person> said.
   ``The two sides have agreed to begin this work immediately upon
resumption of negotiations on <date>Monday</date>. We hope that the sides will
continue to make expeditious progress in these talks.''
   The statement was released as President <person>Reagan</person> arrived in
<location>California</location> for a five-day stay.

<HEAD>Robbery Suspect Was Shot 13 Times; Listed February Goal Of `Get

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A <location>Texas</location> prison escapee who robbed a credit union
and then killed a policeman during a chase was shot 13 times by
officers after his escape was blocked by a television station's
helicopter, authorities say.
   Police also said the man, <person>Phillip Hutchinson</person>, 24, of <location>Arlington</location>,
<location>Va.</location>, had listed his goals for <date>February</date>, and at the top of the list
was penciled: ``Get Money.''
   <person>Hutchinson</person> robbed the credit union <date>Tuesday</date> and during the
ensuing police chase he ran over and killed Detective <person>Robert
Wallis</person>, 51.
   After running into a tree, he took <person>John Laurienti</person> hostage and
forced him to drive him in his pickup truck. A <organization>KCNC-TV</organization> helicopter
piloted by <person>Mike Silva</person> followed <person>Hutchinson</person> and blocked his escape in
a parking lot, and officers shot him to death in the truck cab.
<person>Laurienti</person> escaped injury except for a cut from flying glass.
   The chase and the final confrontation were videotaped by a
cameraman riding with <person>Silva</person>.
   <location>Adams County</location> sheriff's Sgt. <person>Fred Stoll</person> said that because of the
many entrance and exit wounds on <person>Hutchinson</person>'s body, investigators
had difficulty telling how many times he had been shot.
   ``But my guess is 13 times,'' he said <date>Thursday</date>.
   According to authorities, <person>Hutchinson</person> was a <organization>Marine</organization> deserter with
a long criminal record, including escape, robbery, forgery and the
ransom kidnapping of a 13-year-old boy, who escaped unharmed.
   He escaped from <location>Texas</location>' <person>Ferguson</person> prison unit in <date>September 1984</date>
and was recaptured four months later. In <date>July</date>, while serving a life
sentence for aggravated robbery and other charges, <person>Hutchinson</person>
hot-wired a truck and drove it through a prison fence. He had
eluded authorities since then.
   <person>Stoll</person> said police found the list of goals among piles of papers
in <person>Hutchinson</person>'s mountain home near <person>Bailey</person>.
   He was known to write detailed strategies and contingency plans
in advance of his crimes, but investigators have not found plans
for <date>Tuesday</date>'s credit union office robbery, which netted <money>$3,000</money>.
   Meanwhile, <person>Laurienti</person>, 73, was given a new truck <date>Friday</date> to
replace the one damaged in the gun battle.
   The truck was purchased for him by a dealership and <organization>KCNC-TV</organization>.
   <person>Laurienti</person> had refused to obey <person>Hutchinson</person>'s order to ram the
station's helicopter after <person>Silva</person> landed in front of them.
   <person>Laurienti</person> embraced <person>Silva</person> when they met for the first time
<date>Friday</date>, and they discussed <date>Tuesday</date>'s ordeal.
   ``God bless this guy,'' <person>Laurienti</person> said. ``He (<organization>Hutchinson</organization>) could
have blew my brains out, but I wasn't going to ram this guy.''

<TEXT>
   Sen. <person>Bob Dole</person>'s presidential campaign is
wasting no time in trying to lure national convention delegates
away from Vice President <person>George Bush</person>, even though only a handful
have been chosen so far.
   <organization>Dole</organization>'s <location>Pennsylvania</location> campaign has gone to work on at least some
of the 18 delegates who were chosen there last week by the
Republican <organization>State Committee</organization>, and so far one delegate has been
enticed to defect while another is complaining of being harassed.
   ``They're after me,'' <person>Grace Jesberger</person> said <date>Friday</date> in a telephone
interview from from <person>Ridgway</person>, <location>Pa.</location> ``I'm just getting a little miffed
that people are trying to pressure me.''
   The effort has intensified since <person>Bush</person>'s third-place finish in
the <location>Iowa</location> caucuses, but <person>Francis Shane</person>, who leads <person>Dole</person>'s <location>Pennsylvania</location>
campaign, said nobody's trying to twist arms.
   Since <location>Iowa</location>, ``we're getting calls from people rethinking their
positions,'' he said.
   <organization>Dole</organization> spokeswoman <person>Katie Boyle</person> said <person>Jesberger</person> had been persuaded
to switch support to the <organization>Senate</organization> minority leader, but <person>Jesberger</person>
herself said that's not true.
   <person>Jesberger</person> said she has often indicated that she ``has no
problems with <person>Dole</person>.'' But she said she was sticking with <person>Bush</person>, at
least for now, because he is the best qualified candidate.
   However, <person>Dole</person>'s campaign did succeed in winning over <person>Ronald
Reese</person>, an insurance adjuster from <location>Philadelphia</location> who was a member of
<person>Bush</person>'s state steering committee.
   <person>Reese</person> did not return calls to his office or home <date>Friday</date>, but he
told <organization>The Pittsburgh Press</organization> that he left the <person>Bush</person> campaign in part
because it was not paying enough attention to black <organization>Republicans</organization>.
   His defection brought the national delegate count to 46 for <person>Bush</person>
and 35 for <person>Dole</person>. Rep. <person>Jack Kemp</person> has 32 delegates, former television
evangelist <person>Pat Robertson</person> 8 and another 8 remain uncommitted. There
are still 2,148 Republican delegates to be chosen.

<HEAD>Ferraro Says Women's Equality Depends On More Female Officeholders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <person>Geraldine Ferraro</person>, whose vice presidential
nomination marked a peak for the women's equality movement, said
<date>Friday</date> that women must translate their increasing power at the
ballot box to campaigns for elective office.
   ``If you don't run, you can't win,'' Ms. <person>Ferraro</person> said. ``And
just as important, every time a woman runs, women win.''
   Ms. <person>Ferraro</person> addressed some 1,500 women attending a symposium on
women and the Constitution convened by former first ladies <person>Rosalynn
Carter</person> and Lady <person>Bird Johnson</person>.
   She said there are more female officeholders than ever, but the
numbers are not representative of the population.
   ``Women are, by any measure, grossly underrepresented in
elective office,'' Ms. <person>Ferraro</person> said. ``I would say shockingly
underrepresented; however, nobody is shocked. That's simply how it
is.''
   <person>Coretta Scott King</person>, wife of slain civil rights leader <person>Martin
Luther King Jr.</person>, echoed Ms. <person>Ferraro</person> in urging women, particularly
black women, to seek office.
   ``We have a strength and tenacity and a gift for nurturing and
compassion which has been finely honed and tempered in our struggle
to raise families in a sexist society,'' Mrs. <person>King</person> said on the
closing day of the two-day symposium.
   ``Let me put it this way _ if the women of <location>America</location> don't lead
the struggle against poverty, racism and militarism, then we must
ask, who will?'' she said.
   According to the <organization>National Women's Political Caucus</organization>, in <date>1987</date>
women held <percent>14 percent</percent> of the higher statewide elective offices in
the country. At the same time, there are only 23 women serving in
the <organization>House</organization> _ and only one black woman _ two female governors and two
women in the <organization>Senate</organization>.
   Ms. <person>Ferraro</person>, a former congresswoman from <location>New York</location>, said many of
those officeholders are not yet in positions of national power or
leadership, which she said would likely delay nomination of a woman
as a presidential candidate.
   However, more women will become interested in politics and the
numbers elected will increase, she said. Ms. <person>Ferraro</person> said her <date>1984</date>
campaign with Democratic presidential nominee <person>Walter Mondale</person>
inspired thousands of women to write her and describe how the
candidacy inspired them to go to law school, medical school, or run
for office.
   ``Every time a woman runs for any elective office, it's like
throwing a stone in a lake,'' she said. ``The ripple effect is felt
far beyond the immediate point of impact.''
   Mrs. <person>King</person> compared the challenge facing women in the workplace
and in politics to that faced by blacks during the civil rights
struggle led by her late husband. She said women can learn much
from the tactics used by blacks to gain rights.
   ``The movement showed millions of Americans that you can, indeed
you must, defy authority when that authority is in the wrong,''
Mrs. <person>King</person> said.
   Women have become a distinct and powerful voting group in recent
years, Ms. <person>Ferraro</person> said, pointing to the <date>1986</date> mid-term elections
that brought a Democratic majority to the <organization>Senate</organization>. She said nine
<organization>Democrats</organization> won by getting less than <percent>50 percent</percent> of the male vote, and
more than <percent>50 percent</percent> of the female vote.
   ``Women voted more strongly Democratic, and on key issues like
peace, disarmament, social welfare and the environment, differently
from men,'' she said.
   Ms. <person>Ferraro</person> said that after she was nominated for vice president
during the <date>1984</date> <organization>Democratic National Convention</organization> in <location>San Francisco</location>,
the thousands of joyfully weeping women she saw told her that
equality, and a female president, are coming.
   ``She will have shown that she possesses the rare combination of
qualities the American people look for in a president, and then it
will be time. And tears will be cried like you wouldn't believe,''
she said.

<TEXT>
   Six people have been arrested in what
federal officials say is an international counterfeiting scheme
involving thousands of bogus <money>$100</money> bills, and investigators are
trying to determine whether the phony money came from <location>Lebanon</location>.
   The arrests began after an <organization>Iowa State University</organization> student from
<location>Lebanon</location>, <person>Roger Youssef El-Khoury</person>, 25, was taken into custody by
<location>Creston</location> police and federal agents following a tip that suspect
bills had been received by a grocery and department store in
<location>Creston</location>.
   <person>El-Khoury</person> was charged with passing and possessing phony <location>U.S.</location>
money. Federal officials said he had several counterfeit <money>$100</money> bills
in his possession when he was arrested.
   Also arrested during the month-long investigation was <person>Kenny
Neil</person>, 29, who played football for <organization>Iowa State</organization> from <date>1977</date> to <date>1980</date>.
<person>Neil</person>, who has been working for the <organization>Iowa Department of
Transportation</organization>, was a seventh-round draft choice of the <organization>New York
Jets</organization> professional football team in <date>1981</date>.
   He was charged with possessing counterfeit money.
   Also charged were <person>Daniel Lee Habhab</person>, 28, a disc jockey at an
<organization>Ames</organization> nightclub; his roommate, <person>Guy K. Sejaan</person>, 26, a Lebanese citizen
and <organization>Iowa State</organization> student; and two other students, <person>Dale Bahrenfuss</person>,
24, and <person>Dario Anthony Hutchinson</person>, 29.
   <person>Habhab</person> and <person>Sejaan</person> pleaded guilty <date>Thursday</date> to charges of
possessing counterfeit <money>$100</money> bills. They have agreed to testify
against the other four, officials said.
   <location>U.S.</location> Secret Service agent <person>William Lenz</person> of <location>Des Moines</location> said
officials do not know where the phony bills were made or how they
were brought into the <location>United States</location>. He said investigators are
trying to determine whether the money came from <location>Lebanon</location>.
   Documents filed in <organization>U.S. District Court</organization> as part of the guilty
pleas by <person>Habhab</person> and <person>Sejaan</person> include an account of <person>Sejaan</person>'s
conversation last year with two <location>Cedar Rapids</location> men in which they
discussed the possible sale of bogus <location>U.S.</location> currency.
   <person>Sejaan</person> said he talked to <person>El-Khoury</person> because he knew <person>El-Khoury</person>
needed money to stay in school. <person>El-Khoury</person> told him to get <money>$5,000</money> in
counterfeit money from one of the <location>Cedar Rapids</location> men, and on <date>Jan. 11</date>
<person>Sejaan</person> met him in the parking lot of a restaurant, according to the
document.
   The man told <person>Sejaan</person> he was giving him <money>$16,000</money> worth of
counterfeit money and wanted <percent>45 percent</percent> of the proceeds from the
sale. The man also said he expected another shipment of <money>$200,000</money> in
phony money at the end of <date>January</date>.
   <person>Sejaan</person> said he gave <person>El-Khoury</person> 10 <money>$100</money> counterfeit bills and was
paid <money>$405</money>. He later gave <person>El-Khoury</person> 20 more phony bills and gave
<person>Habhab</person>, his roommate, 50 of them, according to the documents.
   Assistant <location>U.S.</location> Attorney <person>Robert Teig</person> of <location>Cedar Rapids</location> would not
comment on the allegations against the <location>Cedar Rapids</location> men. No charges
have been filed against them.
   <person>El-Khoury</person>'s trial is scheduled for <date>March 7</date> in <organization>U.S. District
Court</organization>.
   <person>Sejaan</person> and <person>Habhab</person> will be sentenced on <date>April 22</date>. Each could be

   Democrat <person>Albert Gore Jr.</person>, campaigning with
country music star <person>Johnny Cash</person> on <date>Friday</date>, cited increased violence
and suicide among children as he defended his wife's efforts
against raw music lyrics.
   ``What she has said is parents should be more aware that younger
and younger children are targets of increasingly brutal and
explicit material,'' <person>Gore</person> said.
   Cash, a country performer for more than 30 years, appeared with
<person>Gore</person> at a small rally in the railroad yard of the <organization>Virginia Museum
of Transportation</organization> and planned to travel with the Democratic
presidential candidate to <location>New Hampshire</location>. But snow in <location>New England</location>
forced <person>Gore</person> and <person>Cash</person> to abandon those plans and return to
<location>Washington</location> to await better weather.
   <person>Gore</person>, who has campaigned less in <location>New Hampshire</location> than most of his
rivals while concentrating on the Southern primaries, hoped to make
it to that state before <date>Saturday</date>'s Democratic debate.
   Cash, wearing his trademark black-only attire, enthusiastically
endorsed <person>Gore</person> and said his fellow Tennesseean was the only
presidential candidate he has ever publicly backed.
   ``You know, the <location>Soviet Union</location> has a strong, energetic man,'' <person>Cash</person>
told about 150 people who stood in sub-freezing temperatures.
``What we need is a strong, energetic, young, brilliant man, and
that's what we have in <person>Al Gore</person>.''
   Cash's presence prompted numerous questions at a later news
conference about <person>Gore</person>'s wife <person>Tipper</person>'s work against sexual and
violent lyrics in rock music.
   <person>Gore</person> responded by saying there were epidemics of teen pregnancy
and suicide and an ``epidemic of violence by children against
children.''
   ``In the face of that, I think it's legitimate to ask what is
the effect of children seeing 18,000 murders on television by the
time they graduate from high school. What is the effect of
increasingly explicit material on younger and younger children,''
<person>Gore</person> said.
   ``I'm very proud of what she has done.''
   He said she has never sought to impose censorship but favors
voluntary efforts aimed at letting parents know what is contained
in the music their children listen to.
   <person>Tipper Gore</person>'s well-publicized efforts in that cause have brought
criticism from some in the entertainment industry. But <person>Gore</person>'s poll
takers and strategists say they find little opposition to his
candidacy in the South or elsewhere based on his wife.
   Cash said he saw no point in trying to censor what his child
might hear in music, but added, ``I really don't think that <person>Tipper
Gore</person> is advocating that kind of censorship anyway.''
   Mrs. <person>Gore</person> did not accompany her husband but two of their
children, <person>Albert Jr.</person>, age 5, and <person>Karenna</person>, 14, traveled with him.
   As <person>Gore</person> and <person>Cash</person> spoke, <organization>Norfolk Southern</organization> freight trains rolled
by noisily just a short distance away, prompting <person>Gore</person> to call on
<location>Cash</location> to sing ``a train song.'' Cash, a country music performer for
more than three decades, complied.
   <location>Virginia</location>'s attorney general, <person>Mary Sue Terry</person>, who is expected to
run for governor next year, appeared with <person>Gore</person>, as did the
district's Democratic congressman, <person>Jim Olin</person>, and the city's
Republican Mayor <person>Noel Taylor</person>.
   <person>Gore</person> blasted President <person>Reagan</person> for a lack of leadership on the
deficit and the economy. He said that after the stock market drop
last <date>October</date> <person>Reagan</person> had nothing of substance to say.
   ``The president came out of the <organization>White House</organization> and said, `What?' _
the helicopter engines were going, you know. He said, `They tell me
I've got to go,''' <person>Gore</person> said. ``Well, he's got a point there.''
   <person>Gore</person>, pinning his presidential hopes on the Southern primaries
on <date>March 8</date>, contended that <location>Massachusetts</location> Gov. <person>Michael Dukakis</person> is
unlikely to gain great momentum out of an expected win in <location>New
Hampshire</location>, before the campaign turns South.
   ``It's essentially a two-person race in most of the South,'' he
said, referring to himself and <person>Jesse Jackson</person>.

<HEAD>Police: Family Hires Hitman After Arranged Marriage Goes Awry</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple whose daughter spurned an
arranged marriage and eloped with her cousin allegedly tried to
hire a hitman to kill their son-in-law, his sister and mother and
send pieces of the bodies to <location>Jordan</location>, authorities said <date>Friday</date>.
   Dr. <person>Saud Tarawneh</person>, 46, a gynecologist who became a <location>U.S.</location> citizen
in <date>1980</date>, and his wife, <person>Ghada</person>, 44, were arrested <date>Thursday</date> on a
<location>Broward County</location> warrant in <location>Toledo</location>, <location>Ohio</location>, where they have lived for
several years. Bond for them was set <date>Friday</date> at <money>$1.2 million</money>.
   According to <person>Mike Breece</person>, an investigator with the <organization>Florida
Department of Law Enforcement</organization>, the couple allegedly tried to
arrange the killings to erase the embarrassment from <person>Rhana
Tarawneh</person>'s elopement with her Syrian cousin in <date>1984</date>.
   ``This would not only help them save face, but elevate the
standing of the family in the tribe to an even higher level than it
was before the daughter ran away,'' <person>Breece</person> said.
   The lovers fled from <location>Jordan</location> and eventually moved to <location>Broward
County</location>.
   Police were contacted by a private investigator the <person>Tarawnehs</person>
allegedly asked either to commit the murders himself or arrange for
a hitman.
   <person>Tarawneh</person> and his wife were each charged with three counts of
conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and three counts of
solicitation to commit first-degree murder.
   The alleged intended targets were their unwanted son-in-law,
<person>Mouataz Abdulsamad</person>, 29; his younger sister, <person>Azza</person>; and his mother,
<person>Najwa</person>, 45.
   When <person>Rhana</person> first fled <location>Jordan</location> with her new husband, the family
wanted to send her back and sell her into a prostitution ring,
authorities said.
   But as the embarrassment to the family grew deeper, the parents
allegedly tried to set up the killings of her new husband and his
relatives.
   The plans included instructions for the killer to to hang all
three people, take photographs of the bodies, then cut the mother's
tongue out and sexually mutilate the husband and his sister, <person>Breece</person>
said. Instructions were also included on packaging the body parts
in formaldehyde for shipment to <location>Jordan</location>.
   <person>Breece</person> would not disclose the amount the couple allegedly agreed
to pay for the murders.
   An investigator the parents allegedly tried to hire in early
<date>January</date> told authorities about the plot, and agreed to cooperate
with the state in its criminal investigation, <person>Breece</person> said.
   After getting court permission for wiretaps, agents taped phone
conversations between the investigator and the family, <person>Breece</person> said.
   A state agent and the investigator, who acted as a middle man
for a non-existent hitman, met with the doctor and his wife in
<location>Detroit</location> on <date>Feb. 2</date>, <person>Breece</person> said.
   On <date>Wednesday</date>, the father ``was told the the murders had been
committed and to send his money,'' <person>Breece</person> said. ``Whether or not he
did (send the money), I don't know.''
   <organization>Toledo Municipal Court</organization> Judge <person>Robert Penn</person> continued the case
until <date>Saturday</date> because the <organization>Tarawneh</organization>'s attorney, <person>Jeffrey Goldstein</person>,
was out of town. The couple faces extradition to <location>Florida</location>, <person>Breece</person>
said.

<DATELINE>BECKLEY, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A joyrider who took four late-model cars
and trucks this week has earned the grudging respect of <person>Beckley</person>'s
finest.
   The joyrider was brazen, bold, efficient and 11 years old.
   ``I've never seen anything like it,'' said <person>Patrolman Don Lilly</person>.
``He stole them like a pro.''
   Like many professionals, the young suspect was a specialist. All
four of the stolen vehicles _ two Chevrolets, a <organization>GMC</organization> and a <organization>Buick</organization> _
were <organization>General Motors</organization> products.
   ``He said they were the easiest to steal,'' <person>Lilly</person> said.
   The technique in each theft was the same, he said. The boy broke
the door locks, then broke into the steering column to defeat the
locking mechanism.
   ``Then he'd just start them up and drive off, and all this in a
matter of seconds,'' <person>Lilly</person> said.
   In quick succession <date>Wednesday</date> night, police found two vehicles
taken from a shopping center, one from a mine service company and a
fourth from a home.
   ``We'd find one of the missing cars, and another one would turn
up nearby,'' <person>Lilly</person> said. ``It looks like he just drove them around,
parked them, cranked up another one, and took off.''
   Investigators found the boy through a combination of forensic
evidence and a tip from a witness who saw the suspect near one of
the vehicles.
   ``I was taking fingerprints off of one of the <organization>Blazers</organization> and
noticed they seemed awfully small,'' <person>Lilly</person> said. ``We started
checking, and every one of the seats was pushed up as far as it
would go.''
   Officials contacted the nearest elementary school, described the
suspect and principal <person>Walter Peelish</person> led them to the boy.
   ``I called his grandmother, and she gave her permission for him
to talk to the police,'' <person>Peelish</person> said.
   <person>Peelish</person> said the youth transferred to the school recently after
moving from another state and had not been a difficult student.
   ``A kid's a kid, and they all get a little rowdy, but we've
really had no problems with him,'' he said.
   <person>Lilly</person> said the boy admitted stealing the cars, and gave police
several tips on his methods.
   The boy was released in his grandmother's custody pending
juvenile court action. He is charged with four counts of auto
theft, and one count of grand larceny for removing a stereo from
one of the vehicles.

   <location>Massachusetts</location> Gov. <person>Michael Dukakis</person> said
<date>Friday</date> ``there's a difference between talking about things and
doing things,'' a dig at the long legislative careers of his
Democratic presidential rivals.
   Trudging through a snowstorm that stalled <location>New Hampshire</location>, <person>Dukakis</person>
suggested that his chief Democratic opponents make speeches and
promises while he, as a governor, takes action.
   <person>Dukakis</person> said he is fit to lead ``because I've done it. Because
I've demonstrated I can do it. These just aren't promises; these
just aren't speeches.''
   ``There's a difference between talking about things and doing
things,'' <person>Dukakis</person> said in a snowy campaign stop at <location>Manchester</location>'s
fire department.
   <person>Dukakis</person> finished third in <date>Monday</date>'s <location>Iowa caucus</location> behind <location>Missouri</location>
Rep. <person>Richard Gephardt</person> and <location>Illinois</location> Sen. <person>Paul Simon</person>, both of whom
have long legislative careers.
   Polls leading up to <date>Tuesday</date>'s first-in-the-nation <location>New Hampshire</location>
primary show <person>Dukakis</person> in first place, riding his regional advantage,
with <person>Gephardt</person> and <person>Simon</person> trailing.
   The governor's remarks echoed the recent Republican campaign
tack of Vice President <person>George Bush</person>, who has been contrasting his
executive experience with <person>Bob Dole</person>'s congressional career.
   <person>Dukakis</person> criticized <person>Gephardt</person> for failing to get his legislative
agenda through <organization>Congress</organization>. <person>Dukakis</person> said a <person>Gephardt</person> proposal to impose
trade reprisals against countries that bar imports from the <location>United
States</location> is stalled.
   ``His amendment is dead. It's been killed in a Democratic
<organization>Senate</organization>, which, apparently, he doesn't understand,'' <person>Dukakis</person> said.
   The governor opposes trade barriers, saying they would only
encourage other countries to follow suit.
   ``We aren't going to compete strongly and effectively in this
world by putting walls,'' <person>Dukakis</person> said. ``We're not going to do it
by hunkering down and going back to old ideas and old solutions
that have been tried and failed.''

<HEAD>Researchers Use Monkeys In Vision Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <organization>Emory University</organization> researchers have fitted monkeys
with contact lenses in a study that they hope could yield new ways
to treat babies born with cataracts and other vision disabilities.
   The study at the <organization>Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center</organization>
involves a pediatric ophthalmologist, a primate behavioral
psychologist, neuroscientists and several dozen monkeys.
   In the experiments, rhesus monkeys undergo lens-removal surgery
to simulate the operation performed on a newborn with cataracts,
the cloudiness of the eye lens that often plagues older adults.
   Such cataract surgery is not new. In most cases, when a lens is
removed, the patient can be fitted with corrective contact lenses
or glasses.
   But the surgery poses special problems in young children,
because humans are born without fully developed vision systems; the
eyes and the brain must learn to work together. If deprived of
normal visual stimulation _ such as by cataracts _ special cells
needed for vision fail to mature properly.
   Cataract surgery must be performed in children at a very early
age. Even so, doctors have had poor results in trying to stimulate
development. Despite corrective lenses, the best most children have
achieved has been 20-40 vision.
   In the experiment, the researchers remove a healthy lens from
one eye of each monkey. They fit them with contact lenses made at
the center's lab and try various treatment to prompt successful
vision development.
   ``Hopefully, we'll be able to relate these results to the human
child,'' Dr. <person>Ronald Boothe</person>, the ophthalmologist and behaviorist who
heads the two-year-old study, said in an interview <date>Friday</date>.
   In both monkeys and man, patients with one good eye and one bad
one will rely on the good eye.
   ``If a child's left to his own devices, he'll ignore it (the
damaged eye),'' said Dr. <person>Howard Eggers</person>, a pediatric ophthalmologist
from <location>New York</location>'s <organization>Columbia University</organization> who is working with the Yerkes
primate researchers. ``We want to force usage of the cataract eye.''
   To force use of the weaker eye, a child can be fitted with a
patch over the good eye. Monkeys don't like to wear eye patches, so
the Yerkes monkeys are fitted with a black contact lens over their
good eye.
   In either case, stimulating proper vision development in the bad
eye is not as simple as just blocking the good one, <organization>Eggers</organization> said. If
worn too little, a patch will leave the patient relying on the good
eye; too long, and vision in the patched eye will deteriorate.
   Doctors are unsure how long the patches or black lenses should
be worn to give each eye the proper visual stimulation, <organization>Eggers</organization>
said. ``We don't know the best method, and we obviously cannot
experiment with children.''
   To solve the problem, <organization>Yerkes</organization> researchers are using different
lens routines on different monkeys. Some wear a black contact lens
all the time, some never do, and others wear it for different
intervals.
   Researchers check the study's remaining 20 monkeys every two
hours to make sure they haven't lost their lenses. ``They have a
great ability to rub contact lenses out,'' <organization>Eggers</organization> said. Lost lenses
are quickly replaced.
   Researchers test the monkeys' vision, in part, by showing them
patterns on a video screen and rewarding them with banana pellets
when they recognize the proper pattern _ thus proving their vision
is working.
   After the lens trials, the monkeys are killed so researchers can
examine their brains and the development of their optical nerve
systems, <person>Boothe</person> said.

   Here is the text of <person>Alexander M. Haig
Jr.</person>'s statement <date>Friday</date> announcing his withdrawal from the
Republican presidential race.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   It's evident to me that the contest in <location>Hawaii</location>, <location>Michigan</location>, and
<location>Iowa</location>, and my own assessment of <location>New Hampshire</location>, make it clear that <person>Al
Haig</person> will not be the Republican candidate in <date>1988</date>.
   My choice, therefore, is to work as effectively as I can for the
principles and the policies that led me into the race in the first
place. I'm therefore announcing today my withdrawal as a candidate
for the Republican presidential nomination and my support for the
candidate best qualified to lead this nation.
   To my family, my friends, and my supporters, let me express my
enduring gratitude for the devotion and your help throughout this
campaign. Only in <location>America</location> could a non-politician have achieved even
as much as I have. Even though I was the darkest of the dark
horses, you supported me because you and I believe, at the very
least, we could shape the issues in this campaign. Believe me,
we've done that.
   To my fellow Republicans, and to my fellow Americans, let me say
this. The <date>'88</date> elections should not be about business as usual in
<location>America</location>. Our next president should not be a man who offers simply
more of the same. We need a leader who truly reflects the
mainstream values that made this country great, including hard
work, moral convictions, and tolerance for the diversity of
<location>America</location>. We should have the experience and the skill that comes
from a record of having made a difference. And our next president
should understand that good government means competent government
run by the very best people <location>America</location> can provide.
   In my judgment, Senator <person>Robert Dole</person> is the candidate best able
to lead our country into the <date>'90s</date>. He has risen from among the
people through hard work and honest effort. He has never forgotten
that <location>America</location> is, above all, the adventure of the common man. And he
knows from experience how to make our government work. <person>Bob Dole</person> has
indeed made a difference.
   As a candidate in this campaign, only <person>Bob Dole</person> embodies best my
understanding of the crucial challenges we face and what we must do
to meet them. He knows, and I agree, that we must tackle the
horrendous budget deficit now, without resorting to short-term
gimmicks or destructive tax increases that would cripple our
nation's economy. He knows, and I agree, that the answer to our
trade policy must not be self-defeating protectionism.
   He knows, and I agree, that in dealing with the <location>Soviet Union</location> we
must give <location>Moscow</location> no choice but restraint. And, above all, it is
very clear to me that <person>Bob Dole</person> has the strength of character a
president must have to deal with <person>Mikhail Gorbachev</person>.
   I am proud to offer my support for <person>Bob Dole</person>. I urge each of my
supporters and all Republicans to vote for <person>Bob Dole</person> in this crucial
<location>New Hampshire</location> primary and every primary thereafter. The party needs
<person>Bob Dole</person>; so does <location>America</location>.
   Now, finally, a word about that unique American institution, the
media. Every candidate for a high public office undergoes the most
searching scrutiny from the media. They were fair to me. I hope you
feel I was fair to you.

   Near blizzard conditions disrupted
presidential campaigns and almost brought the state to a halt
<date>Friday</date> with up to two feet of snow predicted and winds gusting to
60 mph.
   ``It's terrible out there,'' state police dispatcher <person>Norman St.
Hilaire</person> said <date>Friday</date>. <person>Weir Lundstedt</person> of the <organization>National Weather Service</organization>
in <organization>Concord</organization> added, ``It's not a day to go out and challenge the
storm.''
   The weather played havoc with campaign schedules, as candidates
worked feverishly to win support before <date>Tuesday</date>'s presidential
primary.
   Staff members scrambled to revise schedules as most candidates
had to scrap events. Several were having trouble flying in or out
of the state, with airports closed. <person>Bob Dole</person> had planned to travel
to <location>New Orleans</location> and <person>Pat Robertson</person> had hoped to go to <location>Washington</location>.
Neither got out of the state.
   <person>Jesse Jackson</person> and <person>Albert Gore Jr.</person>, both in <location>Virginia</location>, and <person>Jack
Kemp</person>, in <location>Washington</location>, were trying to get to <location>New Hampshire</location>.
   Only <person>Richard Gephardt</person> had a campaign event made to order for
such a day _ he was to watch a dog sled race at <location>Opechee Park</location> in
<location>Laconia</location>.
   The curtailed campaigning also put a crimp in news coverage.
   Television crews covering Vice President <person>George Bush</person>, who was
holed up in his hotel part of the day, dashed outside to film the
storm to show why candidates were notcampaigning.
   The <organization>Weather Service</organization> predicted the storm should end after
<time>midnight</time>.

   The flight crews of <location>Brazil</location>'s two
largest airlines went on strike for higher wages <date>Friday</date>, tying up
most domestic and some international flights on the eve of <organization>Carnival</organization>
celebrations.
   Non-Brazilian carriers were not affected by the strike at <organization>Varig</organization>
and <location>Vasp</location> airlines. <organization>Transbrasil</organization>, <location>Brazil</location>'s other major airline,
operated normally after reaching a separate agreement with its
flight crews.
   The <location>Sao Paulo</location> and <location>Rio de Janeiro</location> international airports said the
strike stopped all departures and arrivals of <location>Varig</location> and <person>Vasp</person>.
Shuttle service between <location>Rio</location> and <location>Sao Paulo</location> also was suspended.
   An estimated 30,000 to 40,000 passengers, including many
Carnival tourists, will be affected by the planned three-day
strike, the airlines' press offices said.
   The huge <organization>Carnival</organization> celebration kicks off <date>Saturday</date> and runs until
<date>Ash Wednesday, Feb. 17</date>.
   <person>Edson Antonio Matosinho</person>, one of the directors of <location>Brazil</location>'s
12,000-strong flight crew union, said in a telephone interview that
about 7,000 Varig and <organization>Vasp</organization> employees joined the strike.
   The strike was called to demand a <percent>65 percent</percent> wage hike,
<person>Matosinho</person> said.
   Flight crew workers' salaries range from <money>$385</money> to <money>$3,300</money> a month,
he said.

   Former President <person>Jimmy Carter</person>'s boyhood home,
high school and the railroad depot that served as his <date>1976</date> campaign
headquarters are centerpieces of a project to turn his hometown
into a major tourist attraction.
   The <organization>National Park Service</organization> will assume responsibility for
preserving the <person>Jimmy Carter</person> <organization>National Historic</organization> Site during a
dedication ceremony at the depot on <date>Saturday</date> morning. Those
scheduled to attend include <person>Carter</person>, former officials of his
administration and members of the <location>Georgia</location> congressional delegation.
   About 80,000 visitors a year stop at the small welcome center in
<location>Plains</location>, an agricultural community of 650 residents in the heart of
<location>Georgia</location>'s peanut belt. That is down considerably from the hundreds
of thousands of tourists who visited <location>Plains</location> annually during
<person>Carter</person>'s presidency.
   But in four or five years, after the <organization>Park Service</organization> has built
exhibits, rehabilitated buildings and made other improvements, the
town could attract up to 300,000 visitors a year, said <person>John Tucker</person>,
who will manage the <organization>Carter</organization> site in addition to his duties as
superintendent of the nearby <organization>Andersonville National Historic</organization> Site.
   ``There will be a lot people can see and do,'' <person>Tucker</person> said. ``I
think it'll be a lot more attractive to the people going up and
down I-75.''
   The popularity of the 39th president's hometown will help the
surrounding area, he said.
   ``One of the primary benefits ... would be in the area of
tourism,'' <person>Tucker</person> said. ``That'll be a tremendous economic benefit
to <location>Sumter County</location> and southwest <location>Georgia</location>.''
   President <person>Reagan</person> on <date>Dec. 23</date> signed legislation authorizing the
<organization>Park Service</organization> to acquire <organization>Carter</organization>'s home on the town's main street,
his boyhood home on the outskirts of town, a vacant brick building
where he attended high school and the depot, which houses a <person>Carter</person>
museum.
   Eventually, the <person>Carters</person> will donate their home and its
furnishings to the <organization>Park Service</organization>, but they will occupy the house for
their lifetimes. The <person>Carter</person> home, ringed by a metal fence and
protected by <organization>Secret Service</organization> agents, will be closed to the public
for now.
   Deeds for the railroad depot and high school will be transferred
to the <organization>Park Service</organization> during <date>Saturday</date>'s ceremony.
   In addition to the historic site, the federal legislation also
establishes a 730-acre <person>Jimmy Carter</person> <organization>National Preservation District</organization>
that includes the town and some surrounding areas.
   The <organization>Park Service</organization> plans to acquire easements in the preservation
district, through donations or purchases, to preserve <location>Plains</location>'
small-town, rural character, <person>Tucker</person> said.

<HEAD>Bonoir Sees Possible Loophole in White House Ban on Private Contra
Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional critic of President <person>Reagan</person>'s
<location>Central America</location> policy said <date>Friday</date> the <organization>White House</organization> may have left a
loophole in a directive barring government officials from aiding
private fund-raising efforts for the <organization>Nicaraguan Contras</organization>.
   ``I was disturbed to learn ... that the <organization>White House</organization> instructions
may not apply to all executive branch employees,'' Rep. <person>David
Bonior</person>, D-<location>Mich.</location>, the chief deputy <organization>House</organization> whip, wrote in a letter to
<person>Reagan</person>.
   <organization>White House</organization> chief of staff <person>Howard H. Baker Jr.</person> and national
security adviser <person>Colin L. Powell</person> on <date>Wednesday</date> issued a memorandum
directing that ``no administration official should provide
assistance or encouragement of any kind'' to such fund-raising
efforts.
   But <person>Bonior</person> said the memo was addressed only to <organization>White House</organization> and
<organization>National Security Council</organization> staff members, and not to officials of
the <organization>State Department</organization>, <organization>Pentagon</organization> and the <organization>CIA</organization>.
   ``If the <organization>White House</organization> intentionally excepted the <organization>CIA</organization>, <organization>Defense and
State</organization> departments, they are laying the groundwork for another
Iran-Contra scandal,'' <person>Bonior</person> said in a statement.
   During last summer's congerssional hearings into the <organization>Iran-Contra</organization>
arms and money affair, activities by <organization>White House</organization> and <organization>State
Department</organization> officials to raise money for the Contras, including
those of Lt. Col. <person>Oliver L. North</person>, became a focus of concern over
the ``privatization'' of <location>U.S.</location> foreign policy.
   In the memo, <person>Baker</person> and <person>Powell</person> said ``no administration official
should take a position for or against private support for the
democratic resistance'' and that officials should discourage
discussions of the subject at meetings where they are present.
   <organization>Contra</organization> leaders have said they were actively seeking private
monetary support.
   Meanwhile, <person>Reagan</person> declined an invitation from congressional
leaders to participate in the drafting of a package of strictly
``humanitarian'' aid to the Contras to take the place of the <money>$36
million</money> administration package, which included military aid, killed
by the <organization>House</organization> on <date>Feb. 4</date>.
   <organization>House</organization> Speaker <person>Jim Wright</person>, D-<location>Texas</location>, and other Democratic leaders
had written <person>Reagan</person> on <date>Tuesday</date> to ask for his suggestions, but
<person>Reagan</person> wrote back <date>Thursday</date> that he would not offer ideas, but only
react to any proposal <organization>Congress</organization> might draft.
   ``The outlines of an acceptable package must provide sufficient
aid to sustain the freedom fighters in order to maintain those
pressures that have moved the peace process forward,'' <person>Reagan</person> wrote.
   The statement seemed a clear indication that the administration
will insist on aid that would keep the rebels active as a fighting
force.
   ``Without immediate action by the <organization>Congress</organization>, the <organization>freedom fighters</organization>
will become recklessly exposed, and may soon have to make
irreversible decisions about their own future,'' <person>Reagan</person> said in the
letter. ``Even as I write this letter, we have reliable reports of
new Soviet military shipments to <location>Nicaragua</location>.''
   Current <location>U.S.</location> aid for the rebels, including authority for the <organization>CIA</organization>
to make air drops to fighters in the field inside <location>Nicaragua</location>, ends
<date>Feb. 29</date>.
   In a speech <date>Thursday</date> night to a conservative political group,
<person>Reagan</person> vowed that ``the curtain hasn't fallen'' on aid to the
rebels.
   ``We're not giving up on those who are fighting for their
freedom, and they aren't giving up either,'' <person>Reagan</person> said.
   Asked <date>Friday</date> what the administration intends to do, <organization>White House</organization>
spokesman <person>Marlin Fitzwater</person> said: ``If we can't reach an agreement
(with the <organization>Democrats</organization>), we will have our own package.''
   <person>Fitzwater</person> said no decision has been made whether an
administration package would contain military aid, adding, ``First
of all, we want to see what the speaker (<person>Wright</person>) produces.''
   <person>Fitzwater</person> said that by the end of <date>February</date> there will be another
vote in <organization>Congress</organization> on aid _ either the Democratic plan or an
administration package.

   An airline passenger with a beef over a
bunless hamburger threw his plate and eating utensils at a flight
attendant who was unable to placate him with a First Class roll, an
airline official said <date>Friday</date>.
   <person>Matthew Wallis</person>, 45, of <location>New York City</location>, was booked for
investigation of misdemeanor battery when <organization>American Airlines</organization> Flight
209 from <location>New York</location> landed at <time>10:15 p.m.</time> <date>Thursday</date> at <location>Los Angeles
International Airport</location>. He was freed after posting bail of <money>$500</money>.
   <person>Wallis</person> was one of 50 people aboard the DC-10 who had ordered a
special meal, said <person>Steve McGregor</person>, a spokesman for American, based
in <location>Fort Worth</location>, <location>Texas</location>.
   ``He had ordered a hamburger. For some reason, the hamburger did
not have a bun with it. He became somewhat unhappy with that fact.
Our people notified the lead flight attendant who did obtain a roll
from the First Class section, thinking that might placate him. It
did not,'' <person>McGregor</person> said.
   <person>Wallis</person>' wife, who flew with him on the <location>New York</location> to <location>Los Angeles</location>
flight, ordered the same special meal, <person>McGregor</person> said.
   ``Her hamburger, in fact, did have a bun,'' <person>McGregor</person> said.
   When the proffered roll failed to satisfy <person>Wallis</person>, chief flight
attendant <person>Sue Roen</person>, of <location>Los Angeles</location>, advised the captain of the
problem. He ``told her to read him that portion of the law
outlining passenger misconduct,'' <person>McGregor</person> said.
   She did, but that only appeared to make the passenger angrier,
<person>McGregor</person> said.
   ``After using profanities, he picked up his plate with the knife
and fork still on it and threw it at her (Ms. <person>Roen</person>), hitting her
and narrowly missing a passenger with the flying knife,'' said <location>Los
Angeles</location> police Sgt. <person>Joe Arreola</person>.
   Ms. <person>Roen</person> was uninjured and none of the passengers around <person>Wallis</person>
was hurt, <person>Arreola</person> said.
   <person>Wallis</person> was placed under citizen's arrest by Ms. <person>Roen</person> after she
was struck by the plate. The captain contacted <location>Los Angeles
International Airport</location> and asked that police stand by, <person>McGregor</person> said.
   ``Interference with a flight crew is a federal offense and we
always prosecute. That will be the case here, too,'' <person>McGregor</person> said.
   <person>McGregor</person> was unsure how many passengers were aboard the flight
and didn't know what the menu item was for passengers who had made
no special requests.
