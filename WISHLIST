High-Level Features:
- inter-term dependencies
- incorporating information from multiple sources
- inter-document dependencies (based on a filtered list)
- query iteration
- scoring a single document (repeatedly, but with different parameters)

THINGS TO FIX/IMPROVE:
- Remove the ScoringContext. It's in the way now.
- How do we memoize statistics functions?
- Annotations. We want them, particularly for debugging. How to cleanly
  add them?
- Need some abstraction for getting the physical iterators
- I like the composition of scoring function + filter + iterator, and so
  on. Any more we can do?
- The node representation is clunky and not intuitive. Either
  update the API or refactor out for now. (src: relmodel.scala)
  UPDATE: Need something to describe what's needed to support a data source
  for a term. Maybe just a "TermDescriptor" class?
- To make the toolkit configurable, should we focus on schema-validated JSON
  or a series of case classes? (Note: case classes have a 22-parameter limit,
  but are built into Scala more cleanly than JSON)


An "index" should:
- have a way to map between external ids (keys) and internal ids
(the latter may be of a different type for efficiency reasons)
- provide iterators for a given key, if it exists in the index
- get statistics given a key
