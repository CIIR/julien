High-Level Features:
- inter-term dependencies
- incorporating information from multiple sources
- inter-document dependencies (based on a filtered list)
- query iteration
- scoring a single document (repeatedly, but with different parameters)

THINGS TO FIX/IMPROVE:
- How do we memoize
  - decompression
  - basic feature calculation?

- To make the toolkit configurable, should we focus on schema-validated JSON
  or a series of case classes? (Note: case classes have a 22-parameter limit,
  but are built into Scala more cleanly than JSON)

TODO:

- Cascade Ranking Model
- Cost-Estimate? (check paper)
- Delayed execution
- feature-rewriting (delta-fns)
